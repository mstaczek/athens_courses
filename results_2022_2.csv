of fluid dynamics.","Numerical simulations are
essential to understand the flow phenomena occurring in the harsh environments
of turbomachinery. Further, the computation of efficiencies and global
performance parameters is crucial at the design stage and allows the optimisation
of the shape geometry. Therefore, numerical flow simulations are indispensable
for any engineer designing turbines. 
The lecture shows the practical work process of flow simulators using
application examples and provides the theoretical background. When explaining
the individual work steps of the flow simulation process in the lecture,
special attention is paid to conveying the conceptual understanding of the
physical principles. The theoretical knowledge is applied in a simulation
environment in the afternoon sections. Several models are employed, and the

Please check your availability for the online sessions before applying for this course (see below).After 1990, the
nature of public spaces in post-socialist cities began to expand. With the new
economic model of urban development, in addition to classic streets, squares
and public green spaces in modernist housing estates, we also have gated
communities, shopping centres and privately owned public spaces (POPS). Most
often, POPS are part of new office and commercial projects.At the
workshop, we will discuss the nature of public space and its development and
analyze some examples of POPS in Prague. In groups, students will investigate
POPS urban and architectural characteristics, the form of behavioural control,
and see if and how POPS affects people and their activities in the place. At
the end of the workshop, each group will present one selected POPS in Prague.With this
knowledge, in the second phase of the workshop, students will identify and
describe selected POPS in the city where they are studying. They will perform a
similar analysis as they learned at the Prague workshop. For the next three
weeks after the Prague workshop, there will be twice-a-week a two-hour
consultation at which the students will present the following outcomes:1. identified
POPS in their city2. explain its
history and development3. describe its
urban and architectural features in comparison with the public space in the
vicinity4. describe the
activities that take place in POPS and the forms of control present in POPS.At the end of
the online part of the course, everyone submits a presentation of one selected
POPS in one of the European cities. This way, we will learn about the various
urban forms of POPS, forms of control and activities that take place there. We
can also learn how European policies address the inclusion of the whole society
in the urban space.Virtual

52,Mines Paris - PSL,Physics and Mechanics of Random Media,"Basic knowledge in probability theory, physics and mechanics of solids.","Many solid media and materials (composites, granular media, metals, biomaterials, porous media, soils, rocks, etc.) encountered in materials sciences, geophysics, environmental sciences, energetics, hydrogeology,... display microstructures and structures of several length scales, showing often a non-deterministic disorder. A better understanding and prediction of the resulting multiscale and random nature of materials' mesoscopic and/or macroscopic properties requires a modeling approach based on a combination of probabilistic concepts with methods of physics and mechanics. The course, which aims to provide an introduction to this subject, will be given in a self-contained series of lectures and training sessions on computers. First, motivated by a review of advanced experimental techniques for the microstructure description, and by typical results involving fluctuations present in plasticity, damage, fracture, and flows phenomena in porous media, basic tools of applied probability and random processes are recalled. Then, probabilistic tools for the description random media and models together with their simulation are introduced. At the second stage, physics and mechanics of random media are presented from the standpoint of approximate solutions of partial differential equations with random coefficients. For example, linear electrostatics problems in random media are studied by means of perturbation expansion of the random electric and displacement fields, while bounds on the effective permittivitty and of elastic moduli are derived from variational principles. This approach of homogenization, which can be applied to other physical properties like the composition of permeability, or of the thermal conductivity, is illustrated by third order bounds. The third area of focus concerns the use of numerical techniques and especially FFT-based computations to provide estimates of homogenized properties of random media from Monte Carlo type simulations. Bounds and numerical techniques are then extended to non linear behaviours, like the plasticity of polycrystals. Given the importance of reliability problems in a multitude of engineering applications, several fracture statistics models (brittle, ductile, fatigue) are worked out from a probabilistic approach.",See https://people.cmm.minesparis.psl.eu/users/willot/ESPRM/,Report,on-site,English,3,François WILLOT,"Anne-Françoise Gourgues Lorenzon, Christian Lantuéjoul, Benoit Noetinger, Yves-Patrick Pellegrini, Jesus Angulo, Bruno Figliuzzi, François Willot","MINES ParisTech, 60 Boulevard Saint Michel - 75272 PARIS Cedex 06PARIS",MathematicsMechanics and metal trades,,November 2022,MP08,https://register.athensnetwork.eu/courses/course-show/2634,France

    of the international implications derived from their work, especially those from all the EELISA partners(c)staff in international departments and units at HEIs","Deep
transformations of international relationships together with the rapid
evolution of innovations are leading to renewed geopolitical rivalries and
fragmentation. Understanding the rationale and implications of these
innovations in the international sphere and putting them into the context of
European sovereignty so they can be the subject of education and dissemination
is precisely the rationale for this proposal of an ATHENS activity.In fact,
there is an increasing demand for experts in a particular domain, but able to
understand and manage the challenges of new technologies while reflecting and
reviewing their impact on European values. Vice versa, technologists and
scientists need to be aware on how developments could reshape the delicate
balance of international relationships and what makes us, Europeans, unique.Within this
framework, this course is part of the Jean Monnet Chair on Technology and
Science Diplomacy for European Sovereignty (TechDip) hold at UPM. It is also
part of the activities of the Technology Diplomacy and International
Cooperation Community of EELISA European University.It is
expected that students who are admitted to the program will achieve as learning
outcomes:a)the ability to understand how technological developments work, with a specific focus on their
    governance and international spillovers,b)the ability to think critically and analyse different use cases for technology and science delivery
    in economy and society, andc)the ability to understand the unique advantages of the European approach to technology and science.","1- The new

analyse de l'économie immobilière se propose de fournir une réflexion de base
pour aborder le développement et les mutations récentes des différents marchés
immobiliers, au travers de questions et de problématiques sur la formation des
prix immobiliers, l'articulation entre les marchés immobiliers, les marchés
fonciers et les marchés financiers, ou sur les stratégies économiques et
financières des différents acteurs concernés.The objective of this course is to provide the
economic notions essential to the understanding of the functioning and the
economic and financial analysis of the residential and non-residential real estate
markets. For a long time reduced to the sole question of public financing of
housing, the economic analysis of real estate is now diversified and includes
both classical microeconomic approaches and macroeconomic and mesoeconomic
approaches.Real estate must be considered as an economic activity
that is produced, consumed, traded, financed and managed, while taking into
account its own specificities. Our analysis of the real estate economy aims to
provide a basic reflection on the development and recent mutations of the
different real estate markets, through questions and issues on the formation of
real estate prices, the articulation between real estate markets, land markets
and financial markets, or on the economic and financial strategies of the different
actors involved.","-Les fonctions économiques de l'immobilier-Acteurs et stratégies immobilières.-La formation des prix immobiliers et l'analyse des

students who attend this course will be fluent in procedural object-oriented
programming (Java, C++, Python or equivalent). They will get some knowledge of

complex social organization is often a mystery. What would bring individuals
(people, social insects, birds, artificial agents...) to favor collective
benefit rather than short-term selfish payoff? This is the""hard
problem""of sociality: the return on investment in the collective is
divided by the size of the group, while selfish gains are retained in full.The emergence of
sociality is crucial, not only to understandanimal and human societies,
but also to gain a new insight into many aspects of thedigital life(social media, open-source software communities, Internet technical forums,
cooperation among artificial agents, human-computer verbal interaction,
acceptability of AI).This course will
explore the conditions for stable social behavior. You will be usingcomputer
simulationsto study various phenomena (cooperation, coordination, sharing,
collective problem solving, communication, charity). You will manipulate
severaltheoretical models(including kin selection, reciprocity and
social signaling) that are used to explain these phenomena.","The course will
cover several social phenomena, including: collective decision, the cocktail
party effect, scale-free social networks, the hawk-dove dilemma, cooperation in
insect societies, emergence of segregationism, altruism, the ""tragedy of
the commons"", the ""green-beard"" effect, social coordination,
suicide ""for the group"", honest communication, charity and
competitive helping.Several theoretical
models will be studied, including preferential attachment, kin selection, the
Prisoner’s dilemma, the handicap principle, social signaling. Several of these
models derive from applyingGame Theoryto social dilemma.Computer simulations
will includegenetic algorithmsto simulate natural evolution, and
various basic multi-agent techniques to study collective behavior.AudienceIf

fix and radio-mobile networks, IoT, computer architecture, optimization
techniques.","The TPT20 course aims to outline the fundamental concepts, application
domains and open research topics inherent to Cloud virtualization, both in
large datacenters and in mobile edge environment. Mobile edge corresponds to the
periphery of radio-cellular networks where both fix and mobile users and IoT
devices are connected. Teaching an ATHENS session is challenging on two
aspects: how to introduce a new scientific topic in a successive five days session?
How to satisfy the expectations of an international audience with diverse scientific
backgrounds and cultures? The added-value of the TPT20 curriculum is two-fold.
First, it introduces some of the most significant and up-to-date evolutions of
Cloud computing, in terms of hardware architecture and service management. Secondly,
it alternates didactic courses with lab sessions. As it is the case since the
first edition of the TPT20 course, my colleagues MrSteven Eychenne(Ing. @IBM-France)
and MrCédric LENINIVIN(Ing. @Nexedi) both help me in this
challenging task.In a first step, we propose a brief state of the art on CPU and hardware
architectures. The performance criteria of a blade server (the basic computing
unit within a datacenter) are analyzed (CPU speed, multithread vs. multicore, energy
consumption etc.). We describe then into details the rationale of the typical 2D-fat-tree
optical backplane network architecture of a datacenter. The pros and cons of
this architecture are discussed in reference to the potentialities of all-optical
technologies. The basic rationale of virtual machines (VM) assignment to
physical machines (PM) and migration strategies is presented via bin packing
theory. After these preliminary considerations, the evolution from hypervisors
to Virtual Containers (VC) such as Kubernetes and Docker is briefly discussed. An
original focus is dedicated to the impact of heat dissipation onto real-time VM
migrations. In this perspective, we show how a Pareto optimization approach can
be considered. We conclude this first section by a brief presentation ofCloud
standardizationbodies and the three Cloud business
models considered up to now.The second part of
this course deals with the most innovative aspect of the Cloud domain, namelyCloud Radio
Access Networks(CRAN) andMobile Edge Computing(MEC). CRAN refers to the innovative access infrastructure
that will enable to deport Cloud intelligence close to fix/mobile end-users,
including IoT sensors/actuators.Autonomous vehicles(AV) and more extensively,Intelligent Transportation Systems(ITS), the first two pillar applications of 5G, rely on
Cloud and IoT. In this perspective, we depict into details the basic principles
ofDigital Radio-over-Fiber(D-RoF) and the two underlying standards, namelyCPRIandOBSAI.In our
conclusion, we depict the open perspectives offered by 5G/MEC for future
intelligent transportation systems (ITS).",,Evaluation exam with all documents,on-site,English,4,Maurice GAGNAIRE,Mr Steven Eychenne (Ing. @ IBM-France) and Mr Cédric LENINIVIN (Ing. @ Nexedi),19 place Marguerite Perey91120 Palaiseau,Mathematics,,November 2022,TP20,https://register.athensnetwork.eu/courses/course-show/2664,France

modeling (e.g. sources of uncertainty in a physical system), optimization and
operations research (e.g. uncertainties on supply and demand in the modeling of
a supply chain), vision and machine learning (processing noisy data...), or
quantitative finance (financial risk management...).Numerical simulation is an essential tool for modeling
and analyzing complex systems in many scientific fields (physics, biology,
chemistry, finance, economics, etc.). The expectations associated with it are
multiple: better identification and control of risks, limitation of the costs
of real experiments (car crash tests for example), search for cost-performance
trade-offs, etc. The presence of many sources of uncertainty (on the models,
their parameters, the reference measurements) nevertheless raises the question
of the confidence that can be associated with the decisions and predictions
provided by the simulation.The objective of this course is to present a set of
mathematical methods to model, propagate and analyze these uncertainties in
numerical simulations.At the end of the module, students will-know the

Gis tools.Landscape
    is “an area, as perceived by people, whose character is the result of the action and interaction of natural and/or human factors” (Council of Europe, European Landscape Convention, 2000). The changing conditions of this complex factor that determines
    the variability of our local and national contexts can be effectively measured thanks to quantitative and qualitative indicators, which could be calculated using Gis, thanks to elements of geostatistics and numeric cartography. This course will illustrate,
    then, the speculative basics of the need of using Gis for the quantitative and qualitative landscape analysis.","Monday morning(3 hrs of frCOURSE AGENDA:Monday9:15-11:15:Overview of the course

89,Politecnico di Milano,Modernity and Critic Modernity and Warm modernity. Architectural Concept and landscape icon.,,"Issue:The workshop and the
theory classes proposed within it, aim to develop an experimental approach to
the urban design project. The starting point will be the Warm Modernity
research and it will be update thanks to new external contributes, that will
help to critically read some modern models within the Indian context in order
to stimulate their contemporary reinterpretation.Contents:In the nature of the new
utopia of participatory planning and design exist an approach at times
motivated by noble ideals that has had to reckon with a harsh and unforgiving
reality; at others driven by ideology in an paternalistic attempt to banish the
specter of poverty; or finally an effort driven by a sense of personal
responsibility to find a new way out of a history of oppression.The history of living in
the democratic cities of the world seems to have been played out between Europe
and the United States.Christopher Alexander,
Giancarlo de Carlo, the Smithsons and Cedric Price brought a breath of fresh
air to the world of architecture, in the name of a sharing of the goals and
aims of design. They were the ones who laid the foundations for today’s idea of
an open-source architecture.This wind of change and
hope comes from faraway, however, springing out of a new dialogue in the
tropical belt of the planet, out of the efforts to bring democratic modernity
to postcolonial territories in South Asia and Africa.We can dismiss this
postcolonial modernity or we can seek to understand its complexity and grasp
the feverish yearnings that underpin it. In any case we have to live with its
reality and its global consequences.What are we talking about
when we speak of participatory architecture?Design thinkingTheme:An incremental
project for a city for 80.000 habitants, working at theneighborhood unit’sscale.
The exercise start from the critical reading of Otto Koenigsberger’s protocol

imagine and design the spatial device of 1 neighborhood unit, taking care of
social integration, public administration and the predictable city’s growth. It
has to be considered that it will realistically double its population in 25
years.","Project detailsContext: Orissa, India.Dimension of the

91,Politecnico di Milano,Rigidity in Softness: Aggregated Reinforced Knitted Architecture (ARKA),"Required Skills: Basic knowledge of Grasshopper, Passion for learning-by-doing, Digital
fabrication","RKA is a cross-collaborative workshop between the Stuckeman Center for Design
Computing (SCDC) at The Pennsylvania State University and the Department of
Architecture, Built Environment, and Construction (DABC) of Politecnico di Milano.Architecture can make use of the potential of natural aggregates that can modify themselves in
response to environmental change. Instead of failing, they adjust the equilibrium to equilibrium to
accommodate the new condition. Dieriches (2022) defined Aggregate architecture as “a system
consisting of large numbers of loose elements that are observed and modulated by the architect
on the particle- or system-level to perform one or more typically architectural tasks.”This workshop, originating from a biomimetic approach, will explore the generation of ultralightweight
external secondary facade skin through the utilization of knitted textiles and fiberreinforced
polymer composites. The design methodology will investigate the optimal use of Fiber
Reinforced Polimers (FRP) as secondary structures and the behavior and potential of knitted
textiles for developing shading systems.The aim of the workshop is to investigate and evaluate
the potential of combining knitted textiles with fibrous structures to create ultra-lightweight,
optimized hybrid systems for architectural applications.The workshop is divided into three parts, where the main computational design approach will be
conducted alongside some practical exercise, allowing the participants to become more confident
with the special membrane-based construction materials and the textile-hybrid structural
concepts.The first two parts will be conducted by the use of Grasshopper (Rhino Plugin)Firstly,
the design and optimization of fibrous secondary structures will be explored, and secondly, the
shape and density of knitted textiles will be evaluated considering the environmental analysis for
the shading system. After finalizing the design in the digital world (software), the instructors will
focus on simple and manual fabrication in the real world.
Knitted textiles are new materials in architecture. While these materials have been dominant in
the garment industry for many years, in the last two decades, knits have found their way into
architecture in the shape of outdoor pavilions and building components like shadings. With the
shift of production technology toward computer-numerical control (CNC) machines, it became
possible to program knitted textiles digitally differentiating the material composition locally, thus
optimizing it for specific applications.
On the other hand, although FRPs have been known for several decades, they have recently
won the attention of the building industry thanks to their unique properties such as lightweight,
good tensile properties, etc. Even though this material is unique, we continue to use it in the
form of traditional structural materials such as wood and steel.This workshop presents the use of two unique materials with totally different characteristics and
properties to generate a lightweight shading system. The final system is not FRP or knitted textile
alone, but it will be a combination of these two materials. A unique architectural system with,
components that can be reusable at the end of their service life.The cross-disciplinary workshop can be followed by both students and graduated students from
different academic levels (bachelor's, master's, …). Both computational design practices and
experimental physical trials (with knitted fabrics and architectural textiles for facades) at labs will
be conducted along the week.The participants will first learn the structural design and optimization of fibrous structures through
the use of the Grasshopper platform and Python code.Secondly, they will get familiar with
daylighting analysis of facade and design of man-made knitted textiles according to the
constraints defined during analysis, again in Grasshopper. At this step, the participants not only
are introduced to the design and analysis but also learn about current fabrication methods (e.g.,
robotic fabrication for fibrous structures and fabrication of knitted textiles on industrial CNC
machines).In the last step, after finalizing the final form of the shading system, the participants
will be asked to start to investigate the relationship between knitted textiles and FRP as a
structural material.
The final form will be divided into several parts (depending on the number of participants), and
each one of them will have to knit and fabricate manually the given part.To ensure the unity of
the fabrication process and final shape, the instructors will provide a fabrication kit with
requirements for each participant prior to the workshop. Materials for the preliminary maquette and for final fabrication process will be provided by the
teaching staff.",,prototyping,on-site,English,2,"Alessandra Zanelli, Full professor of Technology of Architecture, And Design of Ultra-lightweight Building Systems","Alessandra Zanelli, Full professor of Technology of Architecture,

catastrophe could be also considered positively as an opportunity, to learn
from, enjoy its anticipation and live through if the society is ready for.
Today, it is inevitable that every city around the world has to face directly
or indirectly the 21st-century impact of global warming. Milan maybe
may not seem to be in the front line, yet, it has all potentials to become one
of the frontiers of resilience.The
course will analyze the main parameters of global warming and Milan case
reactions and anticipations, in both public and institutional levels. As all
collective and individual decisions and actions, fashionable or modest count,
Milan case will be explored from diverse and cross disciplinary point of views.
The course will criticize in specific the evolution of last 15 years of Milan
toward resilience scenarios especially during covid-19 pandemic and post
pandemic period.The
student will work on a short research (visual and/or textual) essay to be
agreed with the professor. The subject will be related to contemporary Milan
response to global warming, with a specific focus on daily routines. It will
include research, images and short movies. The evaluation will consider the
layout quality of the research work.The
student will conceptualize a critical reflection and the hypothesis of target
group(s). The steps of investigation and documentation on will be planned in
advance with the professor. The student will represent, through graphic work,
the outcomes of the research essay. Graphic and scientific quality will also be
considered in the evaluation of the work.","Presentation of the courseGlobal warming issues and
