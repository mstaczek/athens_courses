                                ObjectivesMotto: “Prediction is very difficult especially
of the future” ( Niels Bohr)- The objectives of this course is to answer the following questions:- What is software reliability?- Why are the statistical methods necessary?- How do you measure and predict the software reliability?- A computer is a deterministic machine - why can’t we predict when it will
fail next ?- If software is such a problem why not build it in hardware?- There is evidence that defects have their origin in design errors. It becomes
difficult or impossible to ensure that software contains no faults. The
software reliability is currently a very sensitive area in telecommunications
for example the introduction of new services.The course
presents opportunities in the field of prediction of software reliability and
the tools allowing to characterize the accuracy and quality forecasts.This is a University “ Politehnica “UniversityMaster course offeredat theFaculty ofAutomatic Control and Computer Science.Various methods and
techniques that we approach based on collected data: the software reliability
growth models, statistical tests, among which trend tests (graphic and statistics
methods). The
course is focused on practical applications using software reliability toolkits
on real world projects.

                                Game is a mathematical model of any decision situation, the result of which depends on the decision of at least two different individuals. Since such situations can be found in almost all fields related to our lives, the domain of applications of game theory is exceptionally broad and rich. It covers economics, industry, political and social sciences, transportation, warfare, biology, ethics and many other branches. Game theory not only represents  an outstanding opportunity to persuade a wide audience of the importance, usefulness and even attractiveness of mathematics, it also leads mathematicians and technicians to such fields as ethology, evolutionary biology, social sciences, etc., that would otherwise remain marginal for many of them. The aim of the course is to provide the survey of game theory and its fascinating applications.

                                Research in Fluid Dynamics and Thermodynamics is
highly supported by experimental measurements. This course provides an introduction
to the fundamentals of the PC based DAQ of experimental measurements in Fluid
Dynamics and Thermodynamics. Participants will learn how to plan, set up and
run automatic measurements. The participants will use modern DAQ HW and SW, and
will develop own codes to obtain, store and analyze measured data. In the
practical part of this course, participants will be able to prepare small
experimental measurements.

                                The goal of the course is to acquaint the students
with spectral methods in the theory of linear differential operators coming
both from modern physics and from classical physics, with special emphasis put
on geometrically induced spectral properties. We give an overview of classical
results and also recent developments in the field, and we always attempt to do this
by providing a physical interpretation of the mathematical theorems.

                                Spectral theory is an extremely rich
field, which has found applications in many areas of physics and mathematics.
One reason why it is so attractive on the formal level is that it provides a unifying
framework for problems in various branches of mathematics, for example partial
differential equations, calculus of variations, geometry, stochastic analysis,
etc.1. Motivations. Differential

                                Text is the simplest and most natural representation of information in a
range of areas. Text is a linear sequence of symbols from some alphabet. The text is manipulated in many application areas: processing of
text in natural and formal languages, study of sequences in molecular
biology, music analysis, etc.The design of algorithms that process texts goes back at least thirty
years. In particular, the 1990s produced many new results. This
progress is due in part to genome research, where text algorithms
are often used. The basic problem of text processing concerns string
matching. It is used to access information and this operation is used
very frequently. We have recognized while working in this area that finite automata are very useful tools for understanding and solving many
text processing problems. We have found in some cases that well
known algorithms are in fact simulators of non-deterministic finite automata serving as models of these algorithms. For this reason the material used in this course is based mainly on results from the theory
of finite automata. Because the string is a central notion in this area,
Stringology has become the nickname of this subfield of algorithmic
research.

                                This course introduces the complexity of decisions in the sustainable management of renewable natural resources and their political, environmental and socio-economic evaluation (oil & gas and mining investments, water resources, agri-business...). It illustrates the use of open information and intelligence (satellite imagery, spatial reasoning, open source knowledge extraction) for multilevel situation assessment from global to micro-local.
Starting the week with a very limited knowledge (or 0 knowledge at all) of local actors, situations, perspectives and issues, students will have to produce in 5 days an "expert" analysis on the different scenarios and development strategies in the studied area.
The use case will assess Oil & Gas developments ongoing in Southern Chad and Eastern Niger, with strong political, economic, humanitarian and environmental issues. Students will use real project documentation allowing to have the view of all stakeholders (oil companies, governments, financing institutions, global and local NGO, medias) from different continents (Africa, US, China, Europe) and conduct practical discussions on investment and development strategies for the different stakeholders.
In 2022, the course will assess the situation in Chad and Niger in a context of changing oil prices (with associated changing revenues), difficult relation with US, Chinese and European Oil Companies (transition from Exxon and Glencore to junior companies : change in chinese CNPC strategy), heavy chadian debt towards Glencore (main lender of the country), unsolved political crises (Death in 2021 of Chad's President Deby replaced by his son, Boko Haram situation around lake Chad, Central African Republic, and Sudan turmoil), environmental issues (both in the Oil fields areas and for the two export pipelines through Cameroon and Benin). Each student's group will represent a stakeholder to assess possible sustainable development scenarios in such a complex context.

                                C++ est devenu le langage industriel normalisé incontournable. En effet, il combine les grandes qualités des langages de haut niveau orientés objets à la puissance des langages proches de la machine. Comme toutes les applications comportent des contraintes de temps d’exécution et d’espace mémoire, il permet l’implémentation des logiciels qui nécessitent une manipulation directe des cibles matérielles (systèmes d’exploitation, drivers de périphériques, réseaux, etc.) tout en apportant l’expressivité, la réutilisation, la maintenance, la simplicité d’évolution, la facilité de test, la gestion de gros projets, le passage à l’échelle, la stabilité des codes écrits et la portabilité.C++ est un langage généraliste à large spectre. Ayant été intensivement utilisé dans de nombreux domaines, il devient désormais possible de l’utiliser efficacement dans les applications qui imbriquent une grande variété de disciplines : science et visualisation des données numériques, applications graphiques, réseau, etc.C++ est un des langages de référence des logiciels libres Open Source.C++ est un des principaux langages utilisés dans le monde industriel et dont la connaissance est indispensable à tout futur ingénieur désireux de s’impliquer dans les nombreux domaines connexes aux technologies de l’information et de la communication.

Les notions seront approfondies par un ensemble d'exercices (travaux dirigés) de difficulté croissante.Nous introduirons, au besoin, quelques notions d’algorithmique et de complexité nécessaires pour une bonne compréhension des difficultés inhérentes à la programmation.L'accent sera mis sur l'apprentissage du langage lui-même, plutôt que sur l'apprentissage d'environnements de programmation intégrés, afin que les mécanismes de compilation d'édition de liens et d'exécution soient bien compris.La semaine comportera un projet de programmation.Contenu :- la réutilisabilité et la généricité (pour réduire les coûts de développement : mécanismes orientés objets, classes template)- le contrôle d’accès (séparation de la spécification et de l’implémentation)- le typage fort et le polymorphisme (pour détecter les erreurs le plus tôt possible dans le cycle de développement : structures et classes, dérivation  simple et multiple, surcharge des fonctions et des opérateurs, etc.)- les mécanismes d’exceptions pour la gestion des erreurs à l’exécution- la gestion de la mémoire (mémoire statique, pile d’exécution, mémoire dynamique, surcharge des opérateurs d’allocation et de désallocation)- l’introspection sur les types de données lors de l’exécution- l’utilisation de la  STL, bibliothèque normalisée de classes et de fonctions C++- l'utilisation de la norme du langage C++.Projets de programmation :Une partie du temps de la semaine sera consacrée à la réalisation d'un projet de programmation qui utilise des bibliothèques de programmes extérieures (en plus de la bibliothèque standard C++).Par exemple, cette année, pour l'un des groupes, le projet sera fondé sur la programmation graphique utilisant openGL (bibliothèque graphique pour laquelle vous aurez un cours introductif).Support de cours:Une version électronique des transparents et des listes d'exercices.

                                In a time of competitiveness and scarcity of raw materials, an industrial (indeed, any) system must work in a state not far from its optimum, "small" improvements being sometimes crucial for success or even survival. Operational Research (OR*) supplies specific techniques to optimize and manage, and promotes habits of analysis arising from the inspection of the system model. The central objective of OR is optimization, i.e., "to do things best under the given circumstances", to the greatest profit or smallest cost. This general concept has many applications: agricultural planning, biotechnology, distribution of goods and resources, engineering systems design, environmental management, health care management, inventory control, manpower and resource allocation, manufacturing of goods, military operations, production process control, sequencing and scheduling of tasks, telecommunications, traffic control.Only some of the applications mentioned will be addressed in the course (see Programme below). The computer and the Internet will be indispensable tools.*"Operations Research" in American English.

                                The course covers topics from the traditional theory ofWater
Distribution Networks (WDN) (e.g. fluid flow in pressurized pipes, design of
WDS, water quality assessment and management) to the up-to-date smart water
network, leakage detection and energy recovery.The course makes extensive use of simulation software EPANET, a free
software available at the US Environmental Protection Agency (https://www.epa.gov/water-research/epanet), used
worldwide for hydraulic analysis and water quality analysis in water supply
systems.During the computer simulation practice hours, and under the constant
supervision and guidance from professors, the students will develop an EPANET
model for a given WDN test-case, to analyze it (hydraulically) and finally to
perform a water quality analysis, including the necessary modification of
operation program in order to attain a better quality to consumers, minimizing
the risk of consumers exposure to disinfection by-products, assessing the
system vulnerability to external contamination.Students will also have to pass a final three-hour test, designing and
performing analysis in EPANET for a given WDN; computer aided (documentation is
allowed).

                                The course combines the basic
theory of fluid flow in pressurized pipes, namely in urban drinking Water
Distribution Networks (WDN), with hands-on experience on computer-based
applications.The course makes extensive use
of simulation software EPANET, a free software available at the US
Environmental Protection Agency (https://www.epa.gov/water-research/epanet), used worldwide for
hydraulic analysis and water quality analysis in water supply systems.
Additional computations are performed outside EPANET, using MATLAB and/or a
spreadsheet software (e.g. MS Excel).A step-by-step modelling
approach is followed to design/analyse from hydraulic viewpoint a WDN test-case,
with emphasis on pressure reduction measures and water leakages reduction,
while complaining to smart cities requirements: minimizing the consumption of
electric energy in pumping stations, recovering the hydraulic energy within the
pipe network, optimizing the water consumption at the end-users.Students will have to pass a final three-hour test,
designing and performing hydraulic analysis in EPANET for a given WDN; computer
aided (documentation is allowed).

                                Thiscoursepresents advanced insights into the
development of electricity networks to a new level of performance due, on the
one hand, to the penetration of renewable energy sources and solutions for
energy efficiency, and on the other hand, due to the need to take measures to
increase operation safety and to improve the quality of electricity supply to
consumers. The advanced technologies (power electronics, telecommunications,
computing technology, metering systems, automation, protection, etc.) and the
use of robust algorithms and calculation methods (optimization techniques, control
strategies, energy efficiency solutions, etc.) will allow the electricity
networks transformation into smart grids, as a way of energy transition by sustainable
development. Various smart grid concepts are presented, and references to IEEE
and CIGRE standards and recommendations are provided.

                                Polymers have an important influence on our life. It is practically impossible to show a field which is not affected by polymers. The development of polymers helped the industry to propose new and high performance materials like composites, biopolymers…The use of these materials asks a rich and deep knowledge about the properties of these different types of polymers used for manufacturing of industrial parts: Physical, thermal and mechanical properties.In this course we try to give this knowledge to our young European Engineers.

                                This course will be an introduction to the application of the mechanical principles to the study of the biomechanical behaviour of musculoskeletal and articular systems of human body. It will present clinical and mechanical aspects and will include both experimental and numerical approaches. The final aim of the musculoskeletal and articular biomechanics is to better understand the mechanical behaviour of intact, injured, pathologic of restored human body segments, to help in the design of implants and prostheses, and to help the clinicians in therapeutics strategies.

                                Choices made in the design phase of energy systems have significant consequences at medium and long term. These consequences refer to both economic and environmental impacts.To be able to identify and deal with these long-term effects, a global perspective is needed, including all the stages of an energy system's life cycle, from the extraction and transformation of raw materials to the operation and end-of-life phases.The goal of this course is to provide an overview of existing methods and tools to evaluate the economic and environmental performance of energy systems (estimation of the net present value, life cycle assessment, externalities, carbon footprint...) and complete it with a practical application in team projects.

                                The
course Biopolymers and Biocomposites aims to introduce the students in the
wonderful world of polymeric biomaterials for medical use. After the
introduction in the field of biopolymers and biocomposites, the lecture follows
the presentation of naturally occurring polymers (proteins, polysaccharides).
An important topic of the lecture is dedicated to hydrogels and hydrogel-based
biocomposites and their main biomedical applications. The next chapter focuses
on the chemistry and uses of synthetic polymers for bioenegineering. The
lecture ends with the presentation of the main methods for polymer processing
to manufacture various medical devices: extrusion and injection molding, 3D
printing and electrospinning. Everything is planned to be interactive and
dynamic so that the students could ask questions, and discuss some hot topics
they are interested in. Every day some interesting practical activities are
performed to better understand the field of biopolymers and biocomposites for
bioengineering. Finally, the students will have to pass a two-hours examination
from the topics discussed during the five days lecture.

                                The
dynamics of vehicular traffic in networks is a complex interplay between flow
constraints, queuing phenomena at intersections, and of queue propagation and
spillback over links and nodes of the network. It is a problem of high
complexity, both from a theoretical and from a computational point of view, as
practice requires networks of several (ten) thousands of links and nodes to be
computed within a tight computational budget.This
course starts with traffic flow theory of links (originating from the 1950’s
with kinematic wave theory according to Lighthill, Whitham (1955) and Richards
(1956)) and of nodes (Daganzo, 1995; Tampère et al., 2011). The student learns
the basis of first order traffic flow theory, its mathematical representation
as a partial differential equation, and its graphical/manual solution
techniques. (S)He learns the link between this solution and an algorithmic
solution called ‘Cell Transmission Model’ (CTM), and how this can be
implemented in computer code.In
a next stage, the student learns simplified kinematic wave theory (Newell,
1993) and how it allows for a more efficient algorithmic solution of the
kinematic wave model: the Link Transmission Model (LTM) and its corresponding
computer implementation.In
a final stage, the student learns how to overcome traditional computational
constraints to numerical evaluations of the CTM and LTM. On the one hand,
network flow problems require multiple commodities to be distinguished (e.g.
based on the route or destination of traffic). On the other hand, explicit
numerical schemes are typically bound by an upper limit to the time increment:
the CFL condition. The student learns how this constraint can be relaxed in an
implicit LTM solution scheme, which at the same time allows for marginal
computations and warm-started simulations, yielding accelerations in
computation time of several orders of magnitude (in large networks).

                                Students have some experience with architectural design and are willing to question their designs/way of designing.This course is not open for KU Leuven students!

                                In architectural design there is a tendency to design around a conception of the ‘normal’ user – a six-foot-tall 20-year-old male with a fit and able body that remains invariable over time. Throughout the life span, however, people’s bodies change (from
    newborn to old age) and the diversity in and between users challenges the idea of designing for a ‘normal body’. In this course we focus on children as user.More than most adults, children seemingly care less about designed intentions and spaces/objects offer them possibilities for action that cannot be anticipated – the world of children appears to be less or undetermined, even in a highly structured environment
    like a hospital/child oncology ward. This course seeks to explore how this view on children and (their) everyday practices may help rethinking relations between people, objects and environments and offer new ways of reflecting on designuse relations.To this end, the course combines theoretical investigations and design research experiments in a series of seminars and handson design (and) research sessions.Theoretically, the course is informed by practice theory and childhood studies and starts from the conceptualization of children as ‘everyday designers’; understanding children as active constituents of the world and as situated in relation to everyday
    environments contributing to its making.As a case-study we will work on the redesign of the pediatric oncology ward at UZ Gent (Belgium). Since 2011, the pediatric oncology center of UZ Gent has been housed on the top floor of the newly built Princess Elisabeth Hospital. The center consists
    of 3 departments that are connected to each other and merge into one another: a hospitalization unit, an isolation unit and a day clinic. In addition to rooms, secretarial services, doctors’ and meeting rooms, the department also has multifunctional
    rooms such as a parents’ room, game room, a psychologist’s meeting room and a classroom. Now that the building has been inhabited for a few years, it turns out to constrain some users to participate in practices, e.g. a lack of or misuse of an informal
    meeting space. According to the staff a more suitable design for the parents' room / playroom that meets the needs and requirements of care, is inviting for parents and children and can be used flexibly at the same time, is a possible solution.Through this case-study we bring design practice and theory in dialogue in order to investigate different ways in which the building can be more fitting. This investigation will be seeking answers to the following questions:- If we recognize that the design process continues after a design leaves the drawing board or when a building is finished, what does this mean for architects when designing?- How can architects design in ways that support children as everyday designers?- How does the idea of children as everyday designers question or reinforce current discourses of and practices surrounding children in architectural design?The aim of our experiments is reflective, to act as invitations for people of UZ Gent to see their care environment in a new light, and for the participating students and teaching staff to question prevailing ways of understanding and designing child-friendly
    design/environments. Ultimately, we want to challenge the idea that (built) environments by themselves are child-friendly or not and take a more relational approach to child-friendly design.

                                The topic will be explored through lectures, visits and design research experiments. In addition participating students are required to read specific texts which are made available upfront and will be discussed during the lectures.Students will be asked to present one of their own designs at the beginning of the course as a presentation of themselves.Visit of the pediatric oncology center UZ Gent: as the site is located in Ghent (approximately 80 km from Leuven) daily visits are not feasible. We will organize a visit to the oncology center in Ghent. Students will focus individually on different aspects
    of the building during the site visit that will be collectively discussed and collected during the course. We will use the travel time to reflect on our experiences.For 4 days, students will have time to design a collective proposal. Plan materials of the pediatric oncology center of UZ Gent will be made available to explore the site. At the end of the week students will be asked to present their outcome so far.To become more attentive to everyday practices of children and the interactions with the environments

they are situated in, students will have the opportunity to work with children through participant observation. Students will be

invited to reflect on these exercises and present some of the ‘things’ observed and experienced. Students will work in pairs

according to different aspects relevant for design practice, for example: interaction between children, timeline of static and

dynamic activities of the children, observation of activities of the children, space quality, etc.Required to bring laptop? yes

                                Ann Heylighen is research professor at the KU Leuven Department of Architecture, where she co-chairs the Research[x]Design group (rxd.architectuur.kuleuven.be). Ann does research about design in architecture and related disciplines. She will reflect with the participating students on what the unique ways in which children participate in and carry everyday practices could mean for inclusive design.

Piet Tutenel is PhD-researcher at the KU Leuven Department of Architecture, in the Research[x]Design group. Piet will discuss his ongoing phd-research in which he investigates the experience and design of child oncology wards (http://rxd.architectuur.kuleuven.be/projects/room-for-vulnerability/). Inspired by a socio-material approach Piet explores through working with video everyday practices of/with children by focusing on ‘things’ like an IV-stand or an aquarium. Video fragments will be analyzed with the students. In different design fields a ‘thing perspective’ is becoming increasingly important. In this course we explore how these approaches can be used as a lens in the field of architecture.

                                Extreme value theory is based on different principles than those of conventional statistics; it is designed to study and model exceptional events rather than the average characteristics of natural phenomena. This one-week introductory course will start by presenting exploratory tools to analyze the behavior of extreme values in environmental and insurance data. This will help to motivate the basic principles of the statistical modeling of extreme values and the distributions that characterize them. The two common approaches for assessing the risk of extreme events at a given level, i.e. the block maxima and the peaks over threshold approach, will be introduced and illustrated with real data examples. The course will then cover the non-stationary, the multivariate and the spatio-temporal extensions of the basic theory. The R statistical software (freely available at www.r-project.org) will be used in the practicals, as it contains many easily accessible resources for studying and modeling extremes.

                                The course aims at discussing the renovation of modern urban neighbourhoods focusing on the relationship between built environment and public space, their potential to respond to current social, economic and sustainable challenges while preserving their modern values and cultural identity and significance. The course is committed to develop? a broad basis of critically debate on the principles and strategies that should support the redesign of modern urban areas, their qualities and vulnerabilities, spatial-social values and technical-aesthetical aspects. To achieve that discussion the course will promote the understanding of concepts such as “modern values”, “cultural identity” and “significance” as well as the current urban challenges. 
The involvement of students from different fields of studies (architecture, urban planning, engineering, science, sociology, history, economics, arts, etc.) intends to stimulate an interdisciplinary approach on discussion about modern urban environments. The methodology is based on the analysis and interpretation of cases studies from the city of Lisbon.

                                A one-week studio based programme focused on theoretical modules, site visits, city walks, study of international case studies, and critical thinking of Lisbon’s case studies. The studio work methodology will be based on field work in the city of Lisbon, discussion based on presentations, films/documentaries and text readings.
Students from different fields and backgrounds will be arranged in multidisciplinary groups to discuss urban regeneration experiences and processes and propose potential scenarios to change the nature of deprived areas and improve their competitiveness.
The course follows a learning-centred problem solving and experimentation approach rather than purely teacher-centered learning mode. It explicitly calls for students’ engagement, participation and interaction.

reality; at others driven by ideology in an paternalistic attempt to banish the
specter of poverty; or finally an effort driven by a sense of personal
responsibility to find a new way out of a history of oppression.The history of living in
the democratic cities of the world seems to have been played out between Europe
and the United States.Christopher Alexander,
Giancarlo de Carlo, the Smithsons and Cedric Price brought a breath of fresh
air to the world of architecture, in the name of a sharing of the goals and
aims of design. They were the ones who laid the foundations for today’s idea of
an open-source architecture.This wind of change and
hope comes from faraway, however, springing out of a new dialogue in the
tropical belt of the planet, out of the efforts to bring democratic modernity
to postcolonial territories in South Asia and Africa.We can dismiss this
postcolonial modernity or we can seek to understand its complexity and grasp
the feverish yearnings that underpin it. In any case we have to live with its
reality and its global consequences.What are we talking about
when we speak of participatory architecture?Design thinkingTheme:An incremental
project for a city for 80.000 habitants, working at theneighborhood unit’sscale.
The exercise start from the critical reading of Otto Koenigsberger’s protocol
(1948) for the city of BhubaneswarThe participant has to
imagine and design the spatial device of 1 neighborhood unit, taking care of
social integration, public administration and the predictable city’s growth. It
has to be considered that it will realistically double its population in 25
years.

Gis tools.Landscape
    is “an area, as perceived by people, whose character is the result of the action and interaction of natural and/or human factors” (Council of Europe, European Landscape Convention, 2000). The changing conditions of this complex factor that determines
    the variability of our local and national contexts can be effectively measured thanks to quantitative and qualitative indicators, which could be calculated using Gis, thanks to elements of geostatistics and numeric cartography. This course will illustrate,
    then, the speculative basics of the need of using Gis for the quantitative and qualitative landscape analysis.

                                Every
catastrophe could be also considered positively as an opportunity, to learn
from, enjoy its anticipation and live through if the society is ready for.
Today, it is inevitable that every city around the world has to face directly
or indirectly the 21st-century impact of global warming. Milan maybe
may not seem to be in the front line, yet, it has all potentials to become one
of the frontiers of resilience.The
course will analyze the main parameters of global warming and Milan case
reactions and anticipations, in both public and institutional levels. As all
collective and individual decisions and actions, fashionable or modest count,
Milan case will be explored from diverse and cross disciplinary point of views.
The course will criticize in specific the evolution of last 15 years of Milan
toward resilience scenarios.The
student will work on a short research (visual and/or textual) essay to be
agreed with the professor. The subject will be related to contemporary Milan
response to global warming, with a specific focus on daily routines. It will
include research, images and short movies. The evaluation will consider the
layout quality of the research work.The
student will conceptualize a critical reflection and the hypothesis of target
group(s). The steps of investigation and documentation on will be planned in
advance with the professor. The student will represent, through graphic work,
the outcomes of the research essay. Graphic and scientific quality will also be
considered in the evaluation of the work.
