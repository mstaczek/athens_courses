      Objectives:
    </div>
    <div _ngcontent-c2="" class="col-9 border p-2">
      <div _ngcontent-c2=""><p>In architectural design there is a tendency to design around a conception of the ‘normal’ user – a six-foot-tall 20-year-old male with a fit and able body that remains invariable over time. Throughout the life span, however, people’s bodies change (from
    newborn to old age) and the diversity in and between users challenges the idea of designing for a ‘normal body’. In this course we focus on children as user.
</p>
<p>
    More than most adults, children seemingly care less about designed intentions and spaces/objects offer them possibilities for action that cannot be anticipated – the world of children appears to be less or undetermined, even in a highly structured environment
    like a hospital/child oncology ward. This course seeks to explore how this view on children and (their) everyday practices may help rethinking relations between people, objects and environments and offer new ways of reflecting on designuse relations.
</p>
<p>
    To this end, the course combines theoretical investigations and design research experiments in a series of seminars and handson design (and) research sessions.
</p>
<p>
    Theoretically, the course is informed by practice theory and childhood studies and starts from the conceptualization of children as ‘everyday designers’; understanding children as active constituents of the world and as situated in relation to everyday
    environments contributing to its making.
</p>
<p>
    As a case-study we will work on the redesign of the pediatric oncology ward at UZ Gent (Belgium). Since 2011, the pediatric oncology center of UZ Gent has been housed on the top floor of the newly built Princess Elisabeth Hospital. The center consists
    of 3 departments that are connected to each other and merge into one another: a hospitalization unit, an isolation unit and a day clinic. In addition to rooms, secretarial services, doctors’ and meeting rooms, the department also has multifunctional
    rooms such as a parents’ room, game room, a psychologist’s meeting room and a classroom. Now that the building has been inhabited for a few years, it turns out to constrain some users to participate in practices, e.g. a lack of or misuse of an informal
    meeting space. According to the staff a more suitable design for the parents' room / playroom that meets the needs and requirements of care, is inviting for parents and children and can be used flexibly at the same time, is a possible solution.
</p>
<p>
    Through this case-study we bring design practice and theory in dialogue in order to investigate different ways in which the building can be more fitting. This investigation will be seeking answers to the following questions:
</p>
<p>
    - If we recognize that the design process continues after a design leaves the drawing board or when a building is finished, what does this mean for architects when designing?
</p>
<p>
    - How can architects design in ways that support children as everyday designers?
</p>
<p>
    - How does the idea of children as everyday designers question or reinforce current discourses of and practices surrounding children in architectural design?
</p>
<p>
    The aim of our experiments is reflective, to act as invitations for people of UZ Gent to see their care environment in a new light, and for the participating students and teaching staff to question prevailing ways of understanding and designing child-friendly
    design/environments. Ultimately, we want to challenge the idea that (built) environments by themselves are child-friendly or not and take a more relational approach to child-friendly design.</p></div>

      <div _ngcontent-c2=""><p>
    The topic will be explored through lectures, visits and design research experiments. In addition participating students are required to read specific texts which are made available upfront and will be discussed during the lectures.</p>
<p>Students will be asked to present one of their own designs at the beginning of the course as a presentation of themselves.</p>
<p>Visit of the pediatric oncology center UZ Gent: as the site is located in Ghent (approximately 80 km from Leuven) daily visits are not feasible. We will organize a visit to the oncology center in Ghent. Students will focus individually on different aspects
    of the building during the site visit that will be collectively discussed and collected during the course. We will use the travel time to reflect on our experiences.</p>
<p>For 4 days, students will have time to design a collective proposal. Plan materials of the pediatric oncology center of UZ Gent will be made available to explore the site. At the end of the week students will be asked to present their outcome so far.

they are situated in, students will have the opportunity to work with children through participant observation. Students will be

invited to reflect on these exercises and present some of the ‘things’ observed and experienced. Students will work in pairs

according to different aspects relevant for design practice, for example: interaction between children, timeline of static and

dynamic activities of the children, observation of activities of the children, space quality, etc.</span></font>

      Ann Heylighen is research professor at the KU Leuven Department of Architecture, where she co-chairs the Research[x]Design group (rxd.architectuur.kuleuven.be). Ann does research about design in architecture and related disciplines. She will reflect with the participating students on what the unique ways in which children participate in and carry everyday practices could mean for inclusive design.

Piet Tutenel is PhD-researcher at the KU Leuven Department of Architecture, in the Research[x]Design group. Piet will discuss his ongoing phd-research in which he investigates the experience and design of child oncology wards (http://rxd.architectuur.kuleuven.be/projects/room-for-vulnerability/). Inspired by a socio-material approach Piet explores through working with video everyday practices of/with children by focusing on ‘things’ like an IV-stand or an aquarium. Video fragments will be analyzed with the students. In different design fields a ‘thing perspective’ is becoming increasingly important. In this course we explore how these approaches can be used as a lens in the field of architecture.
