of the future” ( Niels Bohr)- The objectives of this course is to answer the following questions:- What is software reliability?- Why are the statistical methods necessary?- How do you measure and predict the software reliability?- A computer is a deterministic machine - why can’t we predict when it will
fail next ?- If software is such a problem why not build it in hardware?- There is evidence that defects have their origin in design errors. It becomes
difficult or impossible to ensure that software contains no faults. The
software reliability is currently a very sensitive area in telecommunications
for example the introduction of new services.The course

range of areas. Text is a linear sequence of symbols from some alphabet. The text is manipulated in many application areas: processing of
text in natural and formal languages, study of sequences in molecular
biology, music analysis, etc.The design of algorithms that process texts goes back at least thirty
years. In particular, the 1990s produced many new results. This
progress is due in part to genome research, where text algorithms
are often used. The basic problem of text processing concerns string
matching. It is used to access information and this operation is used
very frequently. We have recognized while working in this area that finite automata are very useful tools for understanding and solving many
text processing problems. We have found in some cases that well
known algorithms are in fact simulators of non-deterministic finite automata serving as models of these algorithms. For this reason the material used in this course is based mainly on results from the theory
of finite automata. Because the string is a central notion in this area,
Stringology has become the nickname of this subfield of algorithmic
research.","Five 3-hour lectures:1. Overview of Stringology, string matching problems, string matching and finite automata.2. Forward string matching, dynamic programming and bit parallelism.3.

It illustrates the use of open information and intelligence (satellite imagery, spatial reasoning, open source knowledge extraction) for multilevel situation assessment from global to micro-local.
Starting the week with a very limited knowledge (or 0 knowledge at all) of local actors, situations, perspectives and issues, students will have to produce in 5 days an ""expert"" analysis on the different scenarios and development strategies in the studied area.
The use case will assess Oil & Gas developments ongoing in Southern Chad and Eastern Niger, with strong political, economic, humanitarian and environmental issues. Students will use real project documentation allowing to have the view of all stakeholders (oil companies, governments, financing institutions, global and local NGO, medias) from different continents (Africa, US, China, Europe) and conduct practical discussions on investment and development strategies for the different stakeholders.
In 2022, the course will assess the situation in Chad and Niger in a context of changing oil prices (with associated changing revenues), difficult relation with US, Chinese and European Oil Companies (transition from Exxon and Glencore to junior companies : change in chinese CNPC strategy), heavy chadian debt towards Glencore (main lender of the country), unsolved political crises (Death in 2021 of Chad's President Deby replaced by his son, Boko Haram situation around lake Chad, Central African Republic, and Sudan turmoil), environmental issues (both in the Oil fields areas and for the two export pipelines through Cameroon and Benin).

31,KU Leuven,Dynamic Macroscopic Modeling of Network Vehicular Traffic using the LTM Toolkit,"Some
experience with programming in Matlab, Python, or similar languageThis course is
not open for KU Leuven students !","The
dynamics of vehicular traffic in networks is a complex interplay between flow
constraints, queuing phenomena at intersections, and of queue propagation and
spillback over links and nodes of the network. It is a problem of high
complexity, both from a theoretical and from a computational point of view, as
practice requires networks of several (ten) thousands of links and nodes to be
computed within a tight computational budget.This
course starts with traffic flow theory of links (originating from the 1950’s
with kinematic wave theory according to Lighthill, Whitham (1955) and Richards
(1956)) and of nodes (Daganzo, 1995; Tampère et al., 2011). The student learns
the basis of first order traffic flow theory, its mathematical representation
as a partial differential equation, and its graphical/manual solution
techniques. (S)He learns the link between this solution and an algorithmic
solution called ‘Cell Transmission Model’ (CTM), and how this can be
implemented in computer code.In
a next stage, the student learns simplified kinematic wave theory (Newell,
1993) and how it allows for a more efficient algorithmic solution of the
kinematic wave model: the Link Transmission Model (LTM) and its corresponding
computer implementation.In
a final stage, the student learns how to overcome traditional computational
constraints to numerical evaluations of the CTM and LTM. On the one hand,
network flow problems require multiple commodities to be distinguished (e.g.
based on the route or destination of traffic). On the other hand, explicit
numerical schemes are typically bound by an upper limit to the time increment:
the CFL condition. The student learns how this constraint can be relaxed in an
implicit LTM solution scheme, which at the same time allows for marginal
computations and warm-started simulations, yielding accelerations in
computation time of several orders of magnitude (in large networks).","Monday:

32,KU Leuven,Exploring Children’s Everyday (Design) Practices: Rethinking Indeterminacy in Design,Students have some experience with architectural design and are willing to question their designs/way of designing.This course is not open for KU Leuven students!,"In architectural design there is a tendency to design around a conception of the ‘normal’ user – a six-foot-tall 20-year-old male with a fit and able body that remains invariable over time. Throughout the life span, however, people’s bodies change (from
    newborn to old age) and the diversity in and between users challenges the idea of designing for a ‘normal body’. In this course we focus on children as user.More than most adults, children seemingly care less about designed intentions and spaces/objects offer them possibilities for action that cannot be anticipated – the world of children appears to be less or undetermined, even in a highly structured environment
    like a hospital/child oncology ward. This course seeks to explore how this view on children and (their) everyday practices may help rethinking relations between people, objects and environments and offer new ways of reflecting on designuse relations.To this end, the course combines theoretical investigations and design research experiments in a series of seminars and handson design (and) research sessions.Theoretically, the course is informed by practice theory and childhood studies and starts from the conceptualization of children as ‘everyday designers’; understanding children as active constituents of the world and as situated in relation to everyday
    environments contributing to its making.As a case-study we will work on the redesign of the pediatric oncology ward at UZ Gent (Belgium). Since 2011, the pediatric oncology center of UZ Gent has been housed on the top floor of the newly built Princess Elisabeth Hospital. The center consists
    of 3 departments that are connected to each other and merge into one another: a hospitalization unit, an isolation unit and a day clinic. In addition to rooms, secretarial services, doctors’ and meeting rooms, the department also has multifunctional
    rooms such as a parents’ room, game room, a psychologist’s meeting room and a classroom. Now that the building has been inhabited for a few years, it turns out to constrain some users to participate in practices, e.g. a lack of or misuse of an informal
    meeting space. According to the staff a more suitable design for the parents' room / playroom that meets the needs and requirements of care, is inviting for parents and children and can be used flexibly at the same time, is a possible solution.Through this case-study we bring design practice and theory in dialogue in order to investigate different ways in which the building can be more fitting. This investigation will be seeking answers to the following questions:- If we recognize that the design process continues after a design leaves the drawing board or when a building is finished, what does this mean for architects when designing?- How can architects design in ways that support children as everyday designers?- How does the idea of children as everyday designers question or reinforce current discourses of and practices surrounding children in architectural design?The aim of our experiments is reflective, to act as invitations for people of UZ Gent to see their care environment in a new light, and for the participating students and teaching staff to question prevailing ways of understanding and designing child-friendly
    design/environments. Ultimately, we want to challenge the idea that (built) environments by themselves are child-friendly or not and take a more relational approach to child-friendly design.","The topic will be explored through lectures, visits and design research experiments. In addition participating students are required to read specific texts which are made available upfront and will be discussed during the lectures.Students will be asked to present one of their own designs at the beginning of the course as a presentation of themselves.Visit of the pediatric oncology center UZ Gent: as the site is located in Ghent (approximately 80 km from Leuven) daily visits are not feasible. We will organize a visit to the oncology center in Ghent. Students will focus individually on different aspects

We will use the travel time to reflect on our experiences.For 4 days, students will have time to design a collective proposal. Plan materials of the pediatric oncology center of UZ Gent will be made available to explore the site. At the end of the week students will be asked to present their outcome so far.To become more attentive to everyday practices of children and the interactions with the environments

they are situated in, students will have the opportunity to work with children through participant observation. Students will be

invited to reflect on these exercises and present some of the ‘things’ observed and experienced. Students will work in pairs

according to different aspects relevant for design practice, for example: interaction between children, timeline of static and

dynamic activities of the children, observation of activities of the children, space quality, etc.Required to bring laptop? yes","An oral presentation at the end of the course weekA written reflection and a documentation of the design proposal (e.g., a re-design of the interior, or a re-design of the ward, a design of a concrete intervention,…)  => date to be discussed in dialogue with participating students",on-site,English,4,Prof. Ann Heylighen,"Ann Heylighen is research professor at the KU Leuven Department of Architecture, where she co-chairs the Research[x]Design group (rxd.architectuur.kuleuven.be). Ann does research about design in architecture and related disciplines. She will reflect with the participating students on what the unique ways in which children participate in and carry everyday practices could mean for inclusive design.

Piet Tutenel is PhD-researcher at the KU Leuven Department of Architecture, in the Research[x]Design group. Piet will discuss his ongoing phd-research in which he investigates the experience and design of child oncology wards (http://rxd.architectuur.kuleuven.be/projects/room-for-vulnerability/). Inspired by a socio-material approach Piet explores through working with video everyday practices of/with children by focusing on ‘things’ like an IV-stand or an aquarium. Video fragments will be analyzed with the students. In different design fields a ‘thing perspective’ is becoming increasingly important. In this course we explore how these approaches can be used as a lens in the field of architecture.

This will help to motivate the basic principles of the statistical modeling of extreme values and the distributions that characterize them. The two common approaches for assessing the risk of extreme events at a given level, i.e. the block maxima and the peaks over threshold approach, will be introduced and illustrated with real data examples. The course will then cover the non-stationary, the multivariate and the spatio-temporal extensions of the basic theory.

the urban design project. The starting point will be the Warm Modernity
research and it will be update thanks to new external contributes, that will
help to critically read some modern models within the Indian context in order
to stimulate their contemporary reinterpretation.Contents:In the nature of the new
utopia of participatory planning and design exist an approach at times
motivated by noble ideals that has had to reckon with a harsh and unforgiving
reality; at others driven by ideology in an paternalistic attempt to banish the
specter of poverty; or finally an effort driven by a sense of personal
responsibility to find a new way out of a history of oppression.The history of living in
the democratic cities of the world seems to have been played out between Europe
and the United States.Christopher Alexander,
Giancarlo de Carlo, the Smithsons and Cedric Price brought a breath of fresh
air to the world of architecture, in the name of a sharing of the goals and
aims of design. They were the ones who laid the foundations for today’s idea of
an open-source architecture.This wind of change and
hope comes from faraway, however, springing out of a new dialogue in the
tropical belt of the planet, out of the efforts to bring democratic modernity
to postcolonial territories in South Asia and Africa.We can dismiss this
postcolonial modernity or we can seek to understand its complexity and grasp
the feverish yearnings that underpin it. In any case we have to live with its
reality and its global consequences.What are we talking about
when we speak of participatory architecture?Design thinkingTheme:An incremental
