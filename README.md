# Search and filter Athens Courses in one place!

As you may know, page [https://register.athensnetwork.eu/courses](https://register.athensnetwork.eu/courses) is not too user-friendly. It does not allow to filter available courses by the year of study or language for example. That's exactly why I scrapped all course description pages and gathered them in one place. Have a look [here](https://mstaczek.github.io/athens_courses/)!

### Disclaimer

I did [this webpage](https://mstaczek.github.io/athens_courses/) to facilitate looking for courses offered at the next session of Athens Network students exchange. However, data gathered and presented there is by no means official, might be outdated and is not to be used as the only factor when selecting courses. 

Remember to always use the official data available at https://register.athensnetwork.eu/courses when planning your trip!
