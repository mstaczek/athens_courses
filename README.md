# Search all Athens Courses for the next session in a single page!

As you may know, page [https://register.athensnetwork.eu/courses](https://register.athensnetwork.eu/courses) is not too user-friendly. It does not allow to filter available courses by the year of study or language for example.

## All courses are here: [HERE](https://mstaczek.github.io/athens_courses/)
