                    <p><b>Objectives</b>: Text is the simplest and most natural representation of information in a
range of areas. Text is a linear sequence of symbols from some alphabet. The text is manipulated in many application areas: processing of
text in natural and formal languages, study of sequences in molecular
biology, music analysis, etc.The design of algorithms that process texts goes back at least thirty
years. In particular, the 1990s produced many new results. This
progress is due in part to genome research, where text algorithms
are often used. The basic problem of text processing concerns string
matching. It is used to access information and this operation is used
very frequently. We have recognized while working in this area that finite automata are very useful tools for understanding and solving many
text processing problems. We have found in some cases that well
known algorithms are in fact simulators of non-deterministic finite automata serving as models of these algorithms. For this reason the material used in this course is based mainly on results from the theory
of finite automata. Because the string is a central notion in this area,
Stringology has become the nickname of this subfield of algorithmic
research.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Programme</b>: Five 3-hour lectures:1. Overview of Stringology, string matching problems, string matching and finite automata.2. Forward string matching, dynamic programming and bit parallelism.3. Factor automata, subsequence automata, repetition in text.4. Forward string matching, fail function.5. Backward string matching, models of backward string matching,
Boyer-Moore algorithm.Four 2-hour seminars:1. Mastering finite automata: determinisation, union, intersection, εtransitions removal, elimination of more than one initial states.2. Construction of string matching automata, their determinisation
and simulation.3. Application of factor automata.4. Backward string matching.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Exam</b>: Written exam with the duration of 1 hour, evaluation of the results.</p>

                    <p><b>Objectives</b>: Game is a mathematical model of any decision situation, the result of which depends on the decision of at least two different individuals. Since such situations can be found in almost all fields related to our lives, the domain of applications of game theory is exceptionally broad and rich. It covers economics, industry, political and social sciences, transportation, warfare, biology, ethics and many other branches. Game theory not only represents  an outstanding opportunity to persuade a wide audience of the importance, usefulness and even attractiveness of mathematics, it also leads mathematicians and technicians to such fields as ethology, evolutionary biology, social sciences, etc., that would otherwise remain marginal for many of them. The aim of the course is to provide the survey of game theory and its fascinating applications.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Programme</b>: The course covers:1. Classification and mathematical models of decision situations, history2. Utility theory, rational choice theory3. Explicit form games4. Normal form games5. Bimatrix games, methods for equilibrium strategies search6. Repeated games7. Antagonistic conflict, theory of matrix games8. Two-person cooperative games without transferable payoffs9. N-person cooperative games10. Power indices11. Decisions under risk and uncertainty12. Decisions in conflicts against p-intelligent players</p>

                    <p><b>Objectives</b>: The goal of the course is to acquaint the students
with spectral methods in the theory of linear differential operators coming
both from modern physics and from classical physics, with special emphasis put
on geometrically induced spectral properties. We give an overview of classical
results and also recent developments in the field, and we always attempt to do this
by providing a physical interpretation of the mathematical theorems.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Programme</b>: Spectral theory is an extremely rich
field, which has found applications in many areas of physics and mathematics.
One reason why it is so attractive on the formal level is that it provides a unifying
framework for problems in various branches of mathematics, for example partial
differential equations, calculus of variations, geometry, stochastic analysis,
etc.1. Motivations. Differential
  equations in physics. Unifying framework of spectral theory. Geometrical
  aspects.2. Preliminaries. Glazman's
  classification of Euclidean domains. Elements of functional analysis. The
  point and continuous spectra. Self-adjointness. Quadratic forms. Sobolev
  spaces.3. Quasi-conical domains. Location of
  propagating modes. Dimensional features of the Euclidean space. The Hardy
  inequality. Stability of matter. The crisis of classical physics and the rise
  of quantum mechanics. Mathematical formulation of quantum theory. Virtual
  bound states.4. Quasi-bounded domains. Discrete and
essential spectra. Compactness. Vibrational systems. Spectral isoperimetric
inequalities. The symmetric rearrangement and the Faber-Krahn inequality for

and geographers, nevertheless students of various (however remotely) related
disciplines are welcome to explore its potential.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Objectives</b>: (1) Learning to identify basic patterns and elements
of urban structure and interpret them in the context of urban development.(2) Exploring various urban analysis techniques and
tools in a process combining practical and theoretical inputs.(3) Getting to know (and enjoying!) Prague form the
urbanists´perspective.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Programme</b>: The course includes:•	one-week on-site course in Prague (March 18 - 22) including all Athens activities• three 2-hour lessons of on-line program (March 25 - April 12)The participation in both parts of the course is mandatory. Please check your availability for the online sessions before applying for this course (see below).After 1990, the
nature of public spaces in post-socialist cities began to expand. With the new
economic model of urban development, in addition to classic streets, squares
and public green spaces in modernist housing estates, we also have gated
communities, shopping centres and privately owned public spaces (POPS). Most
often, POPS are part of new office and commercial projects.At the
workshop, we will discuss the nature of public space and its development and
analyze some examples of POPS in Prague. In groups, students will investigate
POPS urban and architectural characteristics, the form of behavioural control,
and see if and how POPS affects people and their activities in the place. At
the end of the workshop, each group will present one selected POPS in Prague.With this
knowledge, in the second phase of the workshop, students will identify and
describe selected POPS in the city where they are studying. They will perform a
similar analysis as they learned at the Prague workshop. For the next three
weeks after the Prague workshop, there will be twice-a-week a two-hour
consultation at which the students will present the following outcomes:1. identified
POPS in their city2. explain its
history and development3. describe its
urban and architectural features in comparison with the public space in the
vicinity4. describe the
activities that take place in POPS and the forms of control present in POPS.At the end of
the online part of the course, everyone submits a presentation of one selected
POPS in one of the European cities. This way, we will learn about the various
urban forms of POPS, forms of control and activities that take place there. We
can also learn how European policies address the inclusion of the whole society
in the urban space.On-line meetings schedule:You have to participate at tree of the following two-hour on-line sessions (UTC+2) (you can choose any of the following dates)December 4 at 9:00am, or 6:00pmDecember 6 at 9:00am, or 6:00pmDecember 8 at 9:00am, or 6:00pmDecember 11 at 9:00am, or 6:00pmDecember 13 at 9:00am, or 6:00pmDecember 15 at 9:00am, or 6:00pm</p>

                    <p><b>Objectives</b>: Hydropower has been developed for more than 120 years, and accounts for around 16% of global electricity generation. Among the renewable technologies, hydropower is by far the dominant source of production, accounting for almost twice the volume of renewable power from solar and wind power together. Still, there is the potential to increase global hydropower generation, particularly in Asia, Africa, Central America, and South America, and hydropower will remain one of the main sources of renewable electricity, together with wind and solar power. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) the installation of new hydropower will and must continue in order to reach climate emission targets. As hydropower is still the only large-scale renewable technology to provide regulated power, the role of hydropower might change into being the principal enabler of the integration of unregulated solar and wind power. In the light of climate change, hydropower is definitely part of the solution by offering significant potentials for reductions in carbon emissions, but will also be directly impacted due to potential change in the water resources available for power production.Though hydropower is now a mature technology, there is room for technological improvements and need for adaptation to new challenges, such as new market conditions, the increasing focus on sustainability, and the role in the water–energy–food nexus. Situated at the crossroads of two major issues for development (i.e. water and energy), hydro reservoirs can often deliver services beyond electricity supply, such as supply of water for irrigation and domestic consumption, water supply to the industry, flood control, navigation/transportation and recreation.The main objective of this course is to give the students an overview of hydropower technology, hydropower resources in Europe and globally, hydropower planning including environmental impacts of hydropower, and how it can contribute in sustainable development together with other renewables.</p>

                    <p><b>Objectives</b>: We are at the dawn of a technological revolution that will fundamentally change our relationships with others and the way we live and work. These changes, in their importance, scope and complexity, will be unlike anything humanity has known until then. We do not yet know what will happen, but one thing is certain: our response must be comprehensive and involve all stakeholders at the global level: the public sector, the private sector, academia and civil society.Technology and the industrial world will also be overturned. In this
situation smart materials and intelligent processes have a special place.Today, it is observed that smart materials are increasingly used for the
realization of technologically important devices and formulations. However, due
to their relative novelty, it is worth asking questions: what are smart
materials, how do they work and what are their applications? The most important
smart materials are:-         
shape memory alloys, polymers and composite which have the capacity of
recovery the initial shape after a large induced form change

-         
thermos-strictive materials; the materials which undergo
changes upon temperature.-         
Chromogenic & Halochromic Materials which change color in
response to electrical, optical, thermal or acidity-         
Magnetostrictive Materials which exhibit change
in shape under the influence of magnetic field and also exhibit change in their
magnetization under the influence of mechanical stress.-         
Piezoelectric materials; they
produce a voltage under applied stressBy Intelligent processes we mean the additive manufacturing. Additive manufacturing
technology is an advanced manufacturing technology used to make parts directly
from a computer-driven program. The additive manufacturing process offers an
efficient technique for manufacturing parts with complicated geometries. The
materials transformed by these techniques are Metals, ceramics, polymer and
composite. The fields of application are vast: medical implants, automotive
products, and so on. Depending to the type of the material; there are several

                    <p><b>Objectives</b>: ObjectivesMotto: “Prediction is very difficult especially
of the future” ( Niels Bohr)- The objectives of this course is to answer the following questions:- What is software reliability?- Why are the statistical methods necessary?- How do you measure and predict the software reliability?- A computer is a deterministic machine - why can’t we predict when it will
fail next ?- If software is such a problem why not build it in hardware?- There is evidence that defects have their origin in design errors. It becomes
difficult or impossible to ensure that software contains no faults. The
software reliability is currently a very sensitive area in telecommunications
for example the introduction of new services.The course
presents opportunities in the field of prediction of software reliability and
the tools allowing to characterize the accuracy and quality forecasts.This is a University “ Politehnica “UniversityMaster course offeredat theFaculty ofAutomatic Control and Computer Science.Various methods and
techniques that we approach based on collected data: the software reliability
growth models, statistical tests, among which trend tests (graphic and statistics
methods). The
course is focused on practical applications using software reliability toolkits
on real world projects.</p>

wonderful world of polymeric biomaterials for medical use. The first part of
the lecture is dedicated to the introduction of biopolymers and biocomposites,
with a special focus on their applications in bioengineering. An important
topic of this lecture is dedicated to hydrogels and hydrogel-based
biocomposites and their main biomedical applications. The next chapter focuses
on the chemistry and use of synthetic polymers for bioengineering. Next, we enter
the wonderful world of artificial cells and tissues with the latest research on
engineered microscopic structures that emulate the features and behavior of
biological cells. The lecture ends with a presentation of the main methods for
polymer processing to manufacture various medical devices: extrusion and
injection molding, 3D printing, and electrospinning. Everything is planned to
be interactive and dynamic so that the students can ask questions and discuss
hot topics in which they are interested. Every day, interesting practical

                    <p><b>Prerequisites</b>: The course is designed for students who are interested in data analysis and machine learning applications. An engineering background, statistical and numerical skills would be beneficial but not necessary.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Objectives</b>: Data-driven
decision-making is becoming a crucial skill to deal with engineering systems
that generate vast amounts of data from the automation system. This module aims
to provide students with an understanding of the general concepts, advantages
and limitations of Data-Driven methods for engineering applications.This
course covers methodologies necessary for inferring useful information and
identifying underlying patterns from raw, incomplete, noisy and corrupted data
that is present in real-life engineering applications. This is achieved by
introducing concepts and methods used to model a wide range of systems based on
available data.The
module will also provide the students with the opportunity to explore advanced
solutions of data analytics such as nonlinear models, model selection and error
estimation.On
completion of the module the student is expected to be able to achieve the
following Learning Objective (LO):·LO1: Describe a number
of models for supervised, unsupervised inference from data. Critically evaluate
statistical analysis. Critically assess the fit of statistical models.·LO2: Assess the
strength and weakness of each of these models, interpret the mathematical
equations from linear algebra, statistics, and probability theory used in the
learning models.·LO3: Implement
efficient learning algorithms in the MATLAB language, applied to engineering
problems.·LO4: Design test
procedures in order to evaluate the model hyperparameters (model selection) and
its error (error estimation). Develop an appropriate experimental research
design for an engineering case study considering practical limitations.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Programme</b>: To be determined</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Exam</b>: To
ensure that our students not only grasp theoretical concepts but also excel in
their practical application, the course's learning objectives will be assessed
through a comprehensive coursework project.Objective: The coursework is designed to
assess students' understanding of theoretical AI principles and their ability
to develop code that addresses tangible engineering challenges. It offers a
platform for students to integrate and apply their knowledge in a practical,
real-world context.Introduction and Discussion: The
coursework will be introduced and thoroughly discussed on the last day of the
course, which is scheduled for 22nd March 2024. This session will provide
students with a clear understanding of the coursework requirements, the scope
of the problems to be addressed, and the expectations in terms of coding and
analytical skills.Duration and Submission: Upon
introduction, students will have a three-week period to complete and submit
their coursework. This timeframe allows students to thoroughly engage with the
problem, apply their skills effectively, and develop a well-considered
solution.Components of Submission: The
submission will consist of two primary components: 1) A detailed report where
the students articulate the problem-solving approach, the application of AI
methods, and the analysis of the results; 2) A Developed code well-documented,
highlighting the application of AI techniques learned during the course.Assessment and Grading: Both the report and
the code will be critically assessed to gauge the student's proficiency in
applying AI methods to solve engineering problems. The grades will reflect the
student's ability to integrate theoretical knowledge with practical skills.</p>

                    <p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Absolute
pre-requisites: programming (as language Phython is preferrable) and algorithms
courses.Proof of correctness, advanced algorithmic techniques
(divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, recursion), advanced data structures
(AVL trees, dictionaries, heaps), and complexity theory (real RAM model of
computation, O-, Theta-, Omega-classes) are a requirement.It’s advised that student have taken discrete mathematics courses, linear algebra and algorithm and data structure courses.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Objectives</b>: The
goal of this course is that the students acquire knowledge and skills to deal
with the basic problems in exact string deterministic pattern recognition as
well as its applications to others fields such MIR or data mining. The basic
problem in exact string pattern recognition is to find efficient algorithms
that, given a large string known as the text and a pattern of short length,
find whether the pattern is found in the text. Optimal algorithms will be
studied as well as generalizations of this basic problem. Applications of these
algorithms will be examined, too.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Programme</b>: Algorithms, its description, correctness,
and time and space complexity.Introduction
and history of exact string deterministic pattern recognition.String
matching: basic algorithms, prefixes and suffixes, naïve algorithm, the
Rabin-Karp algorithm, and more general string recognition problems (2D pattern
recognition and wild-character recognition problem)Linear-time
algorithms for string pattern recognition: the Z-algorithm. The real-time
pattern recognition problem.Suffix trees. Ukkonen’s linear-time
algorithm.Suffix trees and its
applications. More complex problems: longest common substring of two strings,
the substring problem, the DNA contamination problem.Applications of these algorithms to other
fields: music information retrieval; computational linguistics.</p>

                    <p><b>Objectives</b>: There are some matrices such as circulant, Jacobi, Hankel and Toeplitz matrices which have
an interest in many engineering applications and have no space in the ordinary syllabus of
our subjects in Technical Universities. In this course, we intend to introduce the students to
the main properties of these matrices as well as their applications in a wide field, such as
signal processing, Fourier transforms, approximation theory, orthogonal polynomials.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Programme</b>: The proposal includes five sessions in the morning from 9 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. with a 15-min
break at 11:15 a.m and, in the afternoon, the students with online support of the teacher
(zoom or Teams), will work complementary exercises to deep on the morning presentations.1st day. Welcome to the students and a brief conversation about their main interests.
Presentation of the course, timetable, and evaluation method.
An overview of Linear Algebra. Similarity. Orthogonal diagonalization. Circulant matrices.
Quizzes and teamwork.2nd day. The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). Algebraic properties. Convolution and
trigonometric interpolation. Exercises with Matlab.3rd day. Strengths and weaknesses of the DFT. Exploring the Cosine Transforms. Application
to signal processing problems: transmission and reconstruction.4th day. General Orthogonal Polynomials. An algebraic approach. The Hankel matrix.
Properties. Quizzes and teamwork.5th day. An introduction to the use of orthogonal polynomials in approximation theory.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Exam</b>: The students will organize themselves in small groups of three or four people. Each team
will choose a topic among those developed during the course and create a poster with a
summary of the work done during the course. Depending on the number of students, they
can generate different summaries on different topics and develop one or two examples.</p>

                    <p><b>Objectives</b>: The course will explore different aspects of
plant reproductive biology, including floral diversity and floral biology,
pollination agents and mechanisms, and the structure and physiology of seeds
and fruits in flowering plants.The aim of this course is to provide a practical
introduction to plant reproduction, with a focus on hands-on experience. It
emphasizes practical experimental techniques, including visual identification
of the most common plant reproductive structures and direct laboratory
experimentation, aiming to equip students with the skills needed to
independently analyze the reproductive strategies of plant species.If you're a student withan interestin life sciences and seeking a deeper understanding of applied plant biology, this course is right for you!</p>

skills in the spatial quantitative and qualitative analysis of landscape
through the use of GIS tools.Landscape
    is “an area, as perceived by people, whose character is the result of the action and interaction of natural and/or human factors” (Council of Europe, European Landscape Convention, 2000). The changing conditions of this complex factor that determines
    the variability of our local and national contexts can be effectively measured thanks to quantitative and qualitative indicators, which could be calculated using GIS, thanks to elements of geostatistics and numeric cartography. This course will illustrate,
    then, the speculative basics of the need of using GIS for the quantitative and qualitative landscape analysis.Program to be followedMonday morning(3 hrs of frontal lecture, 1 of practical applications): overview of the course and introduction to freeware GIS softwares for the landscape analysis.

                    <p><b>Objectives</b>: Every
catastrophe could be also considered positively as an opportunity, to learn
from, enjoy its anticipation and live through if the society is ready for.
Today, it is inevitable that every city around the world has to face directly
or indirectly the 21st-century impact of global warming. Milan maybe
may not seem to be in the front line, yet, it has all potentials to become one
of the frontiers of resilience.The
course will analyze the main parameters of global warming and Milan case
reactions and anticipations, in both public and institutional levels. As all
collective and individual decisions and actions, fashionable or modest count,
Milan case will be explored from diverse and cross disciplinary point of views.
The course will criticize in specific the evolution of last 15 years of Milan
toward resilience scenarios especially during covid-19 pandemic and post
pandemic period.The
student will work on a short research (visual and/or textual) essay to be
agreed with the professor. The subject will be related to contemporary Milan
response to global warming, with a specific focus on daily routines. It will
include research, images and short movies. The evaluation will consider the
layout quality of the research work.The
student will conceptualize a critical reflection and the hypothesis of target
group(s). The steps of investigation and documentation on will be planned in
advance with the professor. The student will represent, through graphic work,
the outcomes of the research essay. Graphic and scientific quality will also be
considered in the evaluation of the work.</p>

                    <p><b>Objectives</b>: COURSE PROGRAM:Interior design has recently been positively contaminated by furniture trends. The course will analyze the main case history of the biggest companies that set the boundaries of interior design.
Ideation, and production of fashion collections will be analyzed also from the marketing and company organization process. There will be further analysis on national and international Public relations, preliminary studies and collection items. The course will analyze the evolution of fashion firms and their interaction with the interior design brands and what followed next.The student will work on a short research essay to be agreed with the professor. The subject will be fashion in interior design, with a specific focus on design hotels. It will include research and images. The evaluation will consider the layout quality of the research work.
The student will develop a concept design of a hotel room or any other facility of a design hotel.The work on fashion design will be planned in advance with the professor. The student will represent, trough graphic work, the various creative processes (brain storming, mood board and a short video). Graphic quality will be considered in the evaluation of the work.</p>

                    <p><b>Objectives</b>: C++ est devenu le langage industriel normalisé incontournable. En effet, il combine les grandes qualités des langages de haut niveau orientés objets à la puissance des langages proches de la machine. Comme toutes les applications comportent des contraintes de temps d’exécution et d’espace mémoire, il permet l’implémentation des logiciels qui nécessitent une manipulation directe des cibles matérielles (systèmes d’exploitation, drivers de périphériques, réseaux, etc.) tout en apportant l’expressivité, la réutilisation, la maintenance, la simplicité d’évolution, la facilité de test, la gestion de gros projets, le passage à l’échelle, la stabilité des codes écrits et la portabilité. C++ est un langage généraliste à large spectre. Ayant été intensivement utilisé dans de nombreux domaines, il devient désormais possible de l’utiliser efficacement dans les applications qui imbriquent une grande variété de disciplines : science et visualisation des données numériques, applications graphiques, réseau, etc. C++ est un des langages de référence des logiciels libres Open Source.C++ est un des principaux langages utilisés dans le monde industriel et dont la connaissance est indispensable à tout futur ingénieur désireux de s’impliquer dans les nombreux domaines connexes aux technologies de l’information et de la communication.</p>

                    <p><b>Objectives</b>: Choices made in the design phase of energy systems have significant consequences at medium and long term. These consequences refer to both economic and environmental impacts.To be able to identify and deal with these long-term effects, a global perspective is needed, including all the stages of an energy system's life cycle, from the extraction and transformation of raw materials to the operation and end-of-life phases.The goal of this course is to provide an overview of existing methods and tools to evaluate the economic and environmental performance of energy systems (estimation of the net present value, life cycle assessment, externalities, carbon footprint...) and complete it with a practical application in team projects.</p>

                    <p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Students
from different fields of studies are welcome expecting their interest and
engagement to the discussion on the intersection between architecture, urban
planning and education. Digital communication skills (graphic design and
presentations), teamwork orientation and active participation is expected. The
students are required to bring a laptop and a digital camera/smartphone for the
course.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Objectives</b>: The rapid and profound
transformations unfolding in various aspects of our lives compel us to broaden
our perspectives on education and the environments where it thrives. In a world
shaped by globalization, technological advancements, digital innovations,
social, environmental and demographic challenges, information exchange at an
unprecedented pace. This course is dedicated to exploring emergent educational environments,
introducing students to the concept of emergent educational environments,
spanning from traditional classrooms to entire cities, encompassing formal,
non-formal, and informal modes of education. The importance of sustainability
at social, environmental, economic, and cultural levels is emphasized.The groups will need to envision new educational
environments based on prevailing trends, predictions, and signals from current
society. The proposals should be speculative in nature, free from the
constraints of the present, and capable of simulating alternative versions of
educational spaces in the future. Central to the course approach is an
interdisciplinary perspective that encourages active participation from
students with diverse backgrounds, including architecture, education, urban
planning, engineering, design, social sciences, and humanities. By doing so, we
aim to heighten awareness of how architecture profoundly impacts the people who
inhabit these spaces and, conversely, how pedagogical, social, political, and
cultural values influence the design of educational environments. This synergy
of disciplines will foster innovative ideas and holistic solutions for the
challenges that lie ahead in education and architecture.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Programme</b>: A one-week studio-based
programme will center on theoretical modules, site visits, city walks, critical
thinking regarding Lisbon’s case studies. The studio work methodology will be founded
on fieldwork conducted in the city of Lisbon, discussion based on
presentations, films/documentaries and text readings.Students from different fields
and backgrounds will be grouped in multidisciplinary teams, collaborating to explore
the futures of educational spaces through an approach aimed at generating conceptual
ideas/projects based on future scenarios, with the intention of stimulating
debate on social and technological trends of the present.The course embraces a learning-centred
problem-solving and experimentation approach, as opposed to a solely
teacher-centred learning mode. It expressly encourages students' engagement,
participation, and interaction.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Exam</b>: Evaluation will be focused
  on the participation and outcomes produced by students during the course. The
  parameters of evaluation during the course will be divided in 1) case study
  analysis; 2) critical analysis and synthesis; 3) final proposal; 4) class participation;
  5) communication.</p>

Text is a linear sequence of symbols from some alphabet. The text is manipulated in many application areas: processing of\ntext in natural and formal languages, study of sequences in molecular\nbiology, music analysis, etc.The design of algorithms that process texts goes back at least thirty\nyears. In particular, the 1990s produced many new results. This\nprogress is due in part to genome research, where text algorithms\nare often used. The basic problem of text processing concerns string\nmatching. It is used to access information and this operation is used\nvery frequently. We have recognized while working in this area that finite automata are very useful tools for understanding and solving many\ntext processing problems. We have found in some cases that well\nknown algorithms are in fact simulators of non-deterministic finite au\x02tomata serving as models of these algorithms.

Among the renewable technologies, hydropower is by far the dominant source of production, accounting for almost twice the volume of renewable power from solar and wind power together. Still, there is the potential to increase global hydropower generation, particularly in Asia, Africa, Central America, and South America, and hydropower will remain one of the main sources of renewable electricity, together with wind and solar power. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) the installation of new hydropower will and must continue in order to reach climate emission targets. As hydropower is still the only large-scale renewable technology to provide regulated power, the role of hydropower might change into being the principal enabler of the integration of unregulated solar and wind power. In the light of climate change, hydropower is definitely part of the solution by offering significant potentials for reductions in carbon emissions, but will also be directly impacted due to potential change in the water resources available for power production.Though hydropower is now a mature technology, there is room for technological improvements and need for adaptation to new challenges, such as new market conditions, the increasing focus on sustainability, and the role in the water–energy–food nexus. Situated at the crossroads of two major issues for development (i.e. water and energy), hydro reservoirs can often deliver services beyond electricity supply, such as supply of water for irrigation and domestic consumption, water supply to the industry, flood control, navigation/transportation and recreation.The main objective of this course is to give the students an overview of hydropower technology, hydropower resources in Europe and globally, hydropower planning including environmental impacts of hydropower, and how it can contribute in sustainable development together with other renewables.', 'Programme': 'Day 1:The role of hydropower in the energy system Introduction to hydropower technologyHydrology – providing the fuel for hydropower Assessment of the hydropower potentialDay 2:Environmental impacts – hydrological changeEnvironmental impacts – barrier effectsVisit to Sagelva hydrological and meteorological stationsDay 3: Full-day excursion to hydropower sites in the regionDay 4: Environmental impacts mitigationHydropeaking operationsEnvironmental impact assessment proceduresSustainability assessment methodsHydropower technology and structuresDay 5:Numerical and physical hydraulic modelsDesign of hydraulic structuresSediment problems in reservoirs and waterwaysVisit to the hydraulic laboratoryPreparations for examExam (2 hours)The program can undergo changes.', 'Exam': 'The exam will be written in ‘open   book’ format.
