2,Czech Technical University in Prague,Text Searching Algorithms,"Sets, relations, oriented graphs, finite automata, regular expressions.","Text is the simplest and most natural representation of information in a
range of areas. Text is a linear sequence of symbols from some alphabet. The text is manipulated in many application areas: processing of
text in natural and formal languages, study of sequences in molecular
biology, music analysis, etc.The design of algorithms that process texts goes back at least thirty
years. In particular, the 1990s produced many new results. This
progress is due in part to genome research, where text algorithms
are often used. The basic problem of text processing concerns string
matching. It is used to access information and this operation is used
very frequently. We have recognized while working in this area that finite automata are very useful tools for understanding and solving many
text processing problems. We have found in some cases that well
known algorithms are in fact simulators of non-deterministic finite automata serving as models of these algorithms. For this reason the material used in this course is based mainly on results from the theory
of finite automata. Because the string is a central notion in this area,
Stringology has become the nickname of this subfield of algorithmic
research.","Five 3-hour lectures:1. Overview of Stringology, string matching problems, string matching and finite automata.2. Forward string matching, dynamic programming and bit parallelism.3.

Please check your availability for the online sessions before applying for this course (see below).After 1990, the
nature of public spaces in post-socialist cities began to expand. With the new
economic model of urban development, in addition to classic streets, squares
and public green spaces in modernist housing estates, we also have gated
communities, shopping centres and privately owned public spaces (POPS). Most
often, POPS are part of new office and commercial projects.At the
workshop, we will discuss the nature of public space and its development and
analyze some examples of POPS in Prague. In groups, students will investigate
POPS urban and architectural characteristics, the form of behavioural control,
and see if and how POPS affects people and their activities in the place. At
the end of the workshop, each group will present one selected POPS in Prague.With this
knowledge, in the second phase of the workshop, students will identify and
describe selected POPS in the city where they are studying. They will perform a
similar analysis as they learned at the Prague workshop. For the next three
weeks after the Prague workshop, there will be twice-a-week a two-hour

with physical lecturing, there will be two half-day virtual lectures the week
prior to the week in Trondheim.","Hydropower has been developed for more than 120 years, and accounts for around 16% of global electricity generation. Among the renewable technologies, hydropower is by far the dominant source of production, accounting for almost twice the volume of renewable power from solar and wind power together. Still, there is the potential to increase global hydropower generation, particularly in Asia, Africa, Central America, and South America, and hydropower will remain one of the main sources of renewable electricity, together with wind and solar power. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) the installation of new hydropower will and must continue in order to reach climate emission targets. As hydropower is still the only large-scale renewable technology to provide regulated power, the role of hydropower might change into being the principal enabler of the integration of unregulated solar and wind power. In the light of climate change, hydropower is definitely part of the solution by offering significant potentials for reductions in carbon emissions, but will also be directly impacted due to potential change in the water resources available for power production.Though hydropower is now a mature technology, there is room for technological improvements and need for adaptation to new challenges, such as new market conditions, the increasing focus on sustainability, and the role in the water–energy–food nexus. Situated at the crossroads of two major issues for development (i.e. water and energy), hydro reservoirs can often deliver services beyond electricity supply, such as supply of water for irrigation and domestic consumption, water supply to the industry, flood control, navigation/transportation and recreation.The main objective of this course is to give the students an overview of hydropower technology, hydropower resources in Europe and globally, hydropower planning including environmental impacts of hydropower, and how it can contribute in sustainable development together with other renewables.",Day 1:The role of hydropower in the energy system Introduction to hydropower technologyHydrology – providing the fuel for hydropower Assessment of the hydropower potentialDay 2:Environmental impacts – hydrological changeEnvironmental impacts – barrier effectsVisit to Sagelva hydrological and meteorological stationsDay 3: Full-day excursion to hydropower sites in the regionDay 4: Environmental impacts mitigationHydropeaking operationsEnvironmental impact assessment proceduresSustainability assessment methodsHydropower technology and structuresDay 5:Numerical and physical hydraulic modelsDesign of hydraulic structuresSediment problems in reservoirs and waterwaysVisit to the hydraulic laboratoryPreparations for examExam (2 hours)The program can undergo changes.,"The exam will be written in ‘open   book’ format.

19,Arts et Métiers ParisTech,Smart Materials and Intelligent Processes,"Basic
knowledge inmaterials and the mechanics of materials.","We are at the dawn of a technological revolution that will fundamentally change our relationships with others and the way we live and work. These changes, in their importance, scope and complexity, will be unlike anything humanity has known until then. We do not yet know what will happen, but one thing is certain: our response must be comprehensive and involve all stakeholders at the global level: the public sector, the private sector, academia and civil society.Technology and the industrial world will also be overturned. In this
situation smart materials and intelligent processes have a special place.Today, it is observed that smart materials are increasingly used for the
realization of technologically important devices and formulations. However, due
to their relative novelty, it is worth asking questions: what are smart
materials, how do they work and what are their applications? The most important
smart materials are:-         
shape memory alloys, polymers and composite which have the capacity of
recovery the initial shape after a large induced form change

-         
thermos-strictive materials; the materials which undergo
changes upon temperature.-         
Chromogenic & Halochromic Materials which change color in
response to electrical, optical, thermal or acidity-         
Magnetostrictive Materials which exhibit change
in shape under the influence of magnetic field and also exhibit change in their
magnetization under the influence of mechanical stress.-         
Piezoelectric materials; they
produce a voltage under applied stressBy Intelligent processes we mean the additive manufacturing. Additive manufacturing
technology is an advanced manufacturing technology used to make parts directly
from a computer-driven program. The additive manufacturing process offers an
efficient technique for manufacturing parts with complicated geometries. The
materials transformed by these techniques are Metals, ceramics, polymer and
composite. The fields of application are vast: medical implants, automotive
products, and so on. Depending to the type of the material; there are several
additive manufacturing technologies: Selective Laser Melting (SLM), Selective
Laser Sintering (SLS), 3D printing by ultraviolet, melting of the powder by
electron beam, Stereo-lithography of reactive liquids, Fused deposition
modeling (FDM), …","The course of 45 hours includes:From March 18 to 22: face-to-face (on-site course in Paris)The following week: virtual course (at home - 2-3 hours at the end of each day, after 4:30 pm)In this course, we

from different fields of studies are welcome expecting their interest and

planning and education. Digital communication skills (graphic design and
presentations), teamwork orientation and active participation is expected. The
students are required to bring a laptop and a digital camera/smartphone for the

transformations unfolding in various aspects of our lives compel us to broaden
our perspectives on education and the environments where it thrives. In a world
shaped by globalization, technological advancements, digital innovations,
social, environmental and demographic challenges, information exchange at an
unprecedented pace. This course is dedicated to exploring emergent educational environments,
introducing students to the concept of emergent educational environments,
spanning from traditional classrooms to entire cities, encompassing formal,
non-formal, and informal modes of education. The importance of sustainability
at social, environmental, economic, and cultural levels is emphasized.The groups will need to envision new educational
environments based on prevailing trends, predictions, and signals from current
society. The proposals should be speculative in nature, free from the
constraints of the present, and capable of simulating alternative versions of
educational spaces in the future. Central to the course approach is an
interdisciplinary perspective that encourages active participation from
students with diverse backgrounds, including architecture, education, urban
planning, engineering, design, social sciences, and humanities. By doing so, we
aim to heighten awareness of how architecture profoundly impacts the people who
inhabit these spaces and, conversely, how pedagogical, social, political, and
cultural values influence the design of educational environments. This synergy
of disciplines will foster innovative ideas and holistic solutions for the
challenges that lie ahead in education and architecture.","A one-week studio-based
programme will center on theoretical modules, site visits, city walks, critical
thinking regarding Lisbon’s case studies. The studio work methodology will be founded
on fieldwork conducted in the city of Lisbon, discussion based on
presentations, films/documentaries and text readings.Students from different fields
and backgrounds will be grouped in multidisciplinary teams, collaborating to explore
the futures of educational spaces through an approach aimed at generating conceptual
ideas/projects based on future scenarios, with the intention of stimulating
debate on social and technological trends of the present.The course embraces a learning-centred
problem-solving and experimentation approach, as opposed to a solely
teacher-centred learning mode. It expressly encourages students' engagement,
participation, and interaction.","Evaluation will be focused
