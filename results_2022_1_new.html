                                        <p><b>Objectives</b>: ObjectivesMotto: “Prediction is very difficult especially of the future” ( Niels Bohr)- The objectives of this course is to answer the following questions:- What is software reliability?- Why are the statistical methods necessary?- How do you measure and predict the software reliability?- A computer is a deterministic machine - why can’t we predict when it will fail next ?- If software is such a problem why not build it in hardware?- There is evidence that defects have their origin in design errors. It becomes difficult or impossible to ensure that software contains no faults. The software reliability is currently a very sensitive area in telecommunications for example the introduction of new services.The course presents opportunities in the field of prediction of software reliability and the tools allowing to characterize the accuracy and quality forecasts.This is a University “ Politehnica “UniversityMaster course offeredat theFaculty ofAutomatic Control and Computer Science.Various methods and techniques that we approach based on collected data: the software reliability growth models, statistical tests, among which trend tests (graphic and statistics methods).The course is focused on practical applications using software reliability toolkits on real world projects.

Since such situations can be found in almost all fields related to our lives, the domain of applications of game theory is exceptionally broad and rich. It covers economics, industry, political and social sciences, transportation, warfare, biology, ethics and many other branches. Game theory not only represents  an outstanding opportunity to persuade a wide audience of the importance, usefulness and even attractiveness of mathematics, it also leads mathematicians and technicians to such fields as ethology, evolutionary biology, social sciences, etc., that would otherwise remain marginal for many of them. The aim of the course is to provide the survey of game theory and its fascinating applications.

                                        <p><b>Objectives</b>: Text is the simplest and most natural representation of information in a range of areas. Text is a linear sequence of symbols from some alphabet. The text is manipulated in many application areas: processing of text in natural and formal languages, study of sequences in molecular biology, music analysis, etc.The design of algorithms that process texts goes back at least thirty years. In particular, the 1990s produced many new results. This progress is due in part to genome research, where text algorithms are often used. The basic problem of text processing concerns string matching. It is used to access information and this operation is used very frequently. We have recognized while working in this area that finite automata are very useful tools for understanding and solving many text processing problems. We have found in some cases that well known algorithms are in fact simulators of non-deterministic finite automata serving as models of these algorithms. For this reason the material used in this course is based mainly on results from the theory of finite automata. Because the string is a central notion in this area, Stringology has become the nickname of this subfield of algorithmic research.

It illustrates the use of open information and intelligence (satellite imagery, spatial reasoning, open source knowledge extraction) for multilevel situation assessment from global to micro-local. Starting the week with a very limited knowledge (or 0 knowledge at all) of local actors, situations, perspectives and issues, students will have to produce in 5 days an "expert" analysis on the different scenarios and development strategies in the studied area. The use case will assess Oil & Gas developments ongoing in Southern Chad and Eastern Niger, with strong political, economic, humanitarian and environmental issues. Students will use real project documentation allowing to have the view of all stakeholders (oil companies, governments, financing institutions, global and local NGO, medias) from different continents (Africa, US, China, Europe) and conduct practical discussions on investment and development strategies for the different stakeholders. In 2022, the course will assess the situation in Chad and Niger in a context of changing oil prices(with associated changing revenues), difficult relation with US, Chinese and European Oil Companies (transition from Exxon and Glencore to junior companies : change in chinese CNPC strategy), heavy chadian debt towards Glencore (main lender of the country), unsolved political crises (Death in 2021 of Chad's President Deby replaced by his son, Boko Haram situation around lake Chad, Central African Republic, and Sudan turmoil), environmental issues (both in the Oil fields areas and for the two export pipelines through Cameroon and Benin). Each student's group will represent a stakeholder to assess possible sustainable development scenarios in such a complex context.

                                        <p><b>Objectives</b>: C++ est devenu le langage industriel normalisé incontournable. En effet, il combine les grandes qualités des langages de haut niveau orientés objets à la puissance des langages proches de la machine. Comme toutes les applications comportent des contraintes de temps d’exécution et d’espace mémoire, il permet l’implémentation des logiciels qui nécessitent une manipulation directe des cibles matérielles (systèmes d’exploitation, drivers de périphériques, réseaux, etc.) tout en apportant l’expressivité, la réutilisation, la maintenance, la simplicité d’évolution, la facilité de test, la gestion de gros projets, le passage à l’échelle, la stabilité des codes écrits et la portabilité.C++ est un langage généraliste à large spectre. Ayant été intensivement utilisé dans de nombreux domaines, il devient désormais possible de l’utiliser efficacement dans les applications qui imbriquent une grande variété de disciplines : science et visualisation des données numériques, applications graphiques, réseau, etc.C++ est un des langages de référence des logiciels libres Open Source.C++ est un des principaux langages utilisés dans le monde industriel et dont la connaissance est indispensable à tout futur ingénieur désireux de s’impliquer dans les nombreux domaines connexes aux technologies de l’information et de la communication.

                                        <p><b>Programme</b>: Ce cours présentera le langage C++ de la norme C++11 du langage.Généralités :Toutes les constructions du langage seront abordées (d'une manière plus ou moins détaillée selon leur importance). Les notions seront approfondies par un ensemble d'exercices (travaux dirigés) de difficulté croissante.Nous introduirons, au besoin, quelques notions d’algorithmique et de complexité nécessaires pour une bonne compréhension des difficultés inhérentes à la programmation.L'accent sera mis sur l'apprentissage du langage lui-même, plutôt que sur l'apprentissage d'environnements de programmation intégrés, afin que les mécanismes de compilation d'édition de liens et d'exécution soient bien compris.La semaine comportera un projet de programmation.Contenu :- la réutilisabilité et la généricité (pour réduire les coûts de développement : mécanismes orientés objets, classes template)- le contrôle d’accès (séparation de la spécification et de l’implémentation)- le typage fort et le polymorphisme (pour détecter les erreurs le plus tôt possible dans le cycle de développement : structures et classes, dérivation simple et multiple, surcharge des fonctions et des opérateurs, etc.)- les mécanismes d’exceptions pour la gestion des erreurs à l’exécution- la gestion de la mémoire (mémoire statique, pile d’exécution, mémoire dynamique, surcharge des opérateurs d’allocation et de désallocation)- l’introspection sur les types de données lors de l’exécution- l’utilisation de la STL, bibliothèque normalisée de classes et de fonctions C++- l'utilisation de la norme du langage C++.Projets de programmation :Une partie du temps de la semaine sera consacrée à la réalisation d'un projet de programmation qui utilise des bibliothèques de programmes extérieures (en plus de la bibliothèque standard C++).Par exemple, cette année, pour l'un des groupes, le projet sera fondé sur la programmation graphique utilisant openGL (bibliothèque graphique pour laquelle vous aurez un cours introductif).Support de cours:Une version électronique des transparents et des listes d'exercices.

                                        <p><b>Objectives</b>: In a time of competitiveness and scarcity of raw materials, an industrial (indeed, any) system must work in a state not far from its optimum, "small" improvements being sometimes crucial for success or even survival. Operational Research (OR*) supplies specific techniques to optimize and manage, and promotes habits of analysis arising from the inspection of the system model. The central objective of OR is optimization, i.e., "to do things best under the given circumstances", to the greatest profit or smallest cost. This general concept has many applications: agricultural planning, biotechnology, distribution of goods and resources, engineering systems design, environmental management, health care management, inventory control, manpower and resource allocation, manufacturing of goods, military operations, production process control, sequencing and scheduling of tasks, telecommunications, traffic control.Only some of the applications mentioned will be addressed in the course (see Programme below). The computer and the Internet will be indispensable tools.*"Operations Research" in American English.

                                        <p><b>Objectives</b>: The dynamics of vehicular traffic in networks is a complex interplay between flow constraints, queuing phenomena at intersections, and of queue propagation and spillback over links and nodes of the network. It is a problem of high complexity, both from a theoretical and from a computational point of view, as practice requires networks of several (ten) thousands of links and nodes to be computed within a tight computational budget.This course starts with traffic flow theory of links (originating from the 1950’s with kinematic wave theory according to Lighthill, Whitham (1955) and Richards (1956)) and of nodes (Daganzo, 1995; Tampère et al., 2011). The student learns the basis of first order traffic flow theory, its mathematical representation as a partial differential equation, and its graphical/manual solution techniques. (S)He learns the link between this solution and an algorithmic solution called ‘Cell Transmission Model’ (CTM), and how this can be implemented in computer code.In a next stage, the student learns simplified kinematic wave theory (Newell, 1993) and how it allows for a more efficient algorithmic solution of the kinematic wave model: the Link Transmission Model (LTM) and its corresponding computer implementation.In a final stage, the student learns how to overcome traditional computational constraints to numerical evaluations of the CTM and LTM. On the one hand, network flow problems require multiple commodities to be distinguished (e.g. based on the route or destination of traffic). On the other hand, explicit numerical schemes are typically bound by an upper limit to the time increment: the CFL condition. The student learns how this constraint can be relaxed in an implicit LTM solution scheme, which at the same time allows for marginal computations and warm-started simulations, yielding accelerations in computation time of several orders of magnitude (in large networks).

                                        <p><b>Prerequisites</b>: Students have some experience with architectural design and are willing to question their designs/way of designing.This course is not open for KU Leuven students!
                                        </p>

                                        
                                        <p><b>Objectives</b>: In architectural design there is a tendency to design around a conception of the ‘normal’ user – a six-foot-tall 20-year-old male with a fit and able body that remains invariable over time. Throughout the life span, however, people’s bodies change (from     newborn to old age) and the diversity in and between users challenges the idea of designing for a ‘normal body’. In this course we focus on children as user.More than most adults, children seemingly care less about designed intentions and spaces/objects offer them possibilities for action that cannot be anticipated – the world of children appears to be less or undetermined, even in a highly structured environment     like a hospital/child oncology ward. This course seeks to explore how this view on children and (their) everyday practices may help rethinking relations between people, objects and environments and offer new ways of reflecting on designuse relations.To this end, the course combines theoretical investigations and design research experiments in a series of seminars and handson design (and) research sessions.Theoretically, the course is informed by practice theory and childhood studies and starts from the conceptualization of children as ‘everyday designers’; understanding children as active constituents of the world and as situated in relation to everyday     environments contributing to its making.As a case-study we will work on the redesign of the pediatric oncology ward at UZ Gent (Belgium). Since 2011, the pediatric oncology center of UZ Gent has been housed on the top floor of the newly built Princess Elisabeth Hospital. The center consists     of 3 departments that are connected to each other and merge into one another: a hospitalization unit, an isolation unit and a day clinic. In addition to rooms, secretarial services, doctors’ and meeting rooms, the department also has multifunctional     rooms such as a parents’ room, game room, a psychologist’s meeting room and a classroom. Now that the building has been inhabited for a few years, it turns out to constrain some users to participate in practices, e.g. a lack of or misuse of an informal     meeting space. According to the staff a more suitable design for the parents' room / playroom that meets the needs and requirements of care, is inviting for parents and children and can be used flexibly at the same time, is a possible solution.Through this case-study we bring design practice and theory in dialogue in order to investigate different ways in which the building can be more fitting. This investigation will be seeking answers to the following questions:- If we recognize that the design process continues after a design leaves the drawing board or when a building is finished, what does this mean for architects when designing?- How can architects design in ways that support children as everyday designers?- How does the idea of children as everyday designers question or reinforce current discourses of and practices surrounding children in architectural design?The aim of our experiments is reflective, to act as invitations for people of UZ Gent to see their care environment in a new light, and for the participating students and teaching staff to question prevailing ways of understanding and designing child-friendly     design/environments. Ultimately, we want to challenge the idea that (built) environments by themselves are child-friendly or not and take a more relational approach to child-friendly design.

                                        <p><b>Programme</b>: The topic will be explored through lectures, visits and design research experiments. In addition participating students are required to read specific texts which are made available upfront and will be discussed during the lectures.Students will be asked to present one of their own designs at the beginning of the course as a presentation of themselves.Visit of the pediatric oncology center UZ Gent: as the site is located in Ghent (approximately 80 km from Leuven) daily visits are not feasible. We will organize a visit to the oncology center in Ghent. Students will focus individually on different aspects     of the building during the site visit that will be collectively discussed and collected during the course. We will use the travel time to reflect on our experiences.For 4 days, students will have time to design a collective proposal. Plan materials of the pediatric oncology center of UZ Gent will be made available to explore the site. At the end of the week students will be asked to present their outcome so far.To become more attentive to everyday practices of children and the interactions with the environments  they are situated in, students will have the opportunity to work with children through participant observation. Students will be  invited to reflect on these exercises and present some of the ‘things’ observed and experienced. Students will work in pairs  according to different aspects relevant for design practice, for example: interaction between children, timeline of static and  dynamic activities of the children, observation of activities of the children, space quality, etc.Required to bring laptop? yes

                                        <p><b>Objectives</b>: Extreme value theory is based on different principles than those of conventional statistics; it is designed to study and model exceptional events rather than the average characteristics of natural phenomena. This one-week introductory course will start by presenting exploratory tools to analyze the behavior of extreme values in environmental and insurance data. This will help to motivate the basic principles of the statistical modeling of extreme values and the distributions that characterize them. The two common approaches for assessing the risk of extreme events at a given level, i.e. the block maxima and the peaks over threshold approach, will be introduced and illustrated with real data examples. The course will then cover the non-stationary, the multivariate and the spatio-temporal extensions of the basic theory. The R statistical software (freely available at www.r-project.org) will be used in the practicals, as it contains many easily accessible resources for studying and modeling extremes.

The course is committed to develop? a broad basis of critically debate on the principles and strategies that should support the redesign of modern urban areas, their qualities and vulnerabilities, spatial-social values and technical-aesthetical aspects. To achieve that discussion the course will promote the understanding of concepts such as “modern values”, “cultural identity” and “significance” as well as the current urban challenges.  The involvement of students from different fields of studies (architecture, urban planning, engineering, science, sociology, history, economics, arts, etc.) intends to stimulate an interdisciplinary approach on discussion about modern urban environments. The methodology is based on the analysis and interpretation of cases studies from the city of Lisbon.

The studio work methodology will be based on field work in the city of Lisbon, discussion based on presentations, films/documentaries and text readings. Students from different fields and backgrounds will be arranged in multidisciplinary groups to discuss urban regeneration experiences and processes and propose potential scenarios to change the nature of deprived areas and improve their competitiveness. The course follows a learning-centred problem solving and experimentation approach rather than purely teacher-centered learning mode. It explicitly calls for students’ engagement, participation and interaction.

The starting point will be the Warm Modernity research and it will be update thanks to new external contributes, that will help to critically read some modern models within the Indian context in order to stimulate their contemporary reinterpretation.Contents:In the nature of the new utopia of participatory planning and design exist an approach at times motivated by noble ideals that has had to reckon with a harsh and unforgiving reality; at others driven by ideology in an paternalistic attempt to banish the specter of poverty; or finally an effort driven by a sense of personal responsibility to find a new way out of a history of oppression.The history of living in the democratic cities of the world seems to have been played out between Europe and the United States.Christopher Alexander, Giancarlo de Carlo, the Smithsons and Cedric Price brought a breath of fresh air to the world of architecture, in the name of a sharing of the goals and aims of design. They were the ones who laid the foundations for today’s idea of an open-source architecture.This wind of change and hope comes from faraway, however, springing out of a new dialogue in the tropical belt of the planet, out of the efforts to bring democratic modernity to postcolonial territories in South Asia and Africa.We can dismiss this postcolonial modernity or we can seek to understand its complexity and grasp the feverish yearnings that underpin it. In any case we have to live with its reality and its global consequences.What are we talking about when we speak of participatory architecture?Design thinkingTheme:An incremental project for a city for 80.000 habitants, working at theneighborhood unit’sscale. The exercise start from the critical reading of Otto Koenigsberger’s protocol (1948) for the city of BhubaneswarThe participant has to imagine and design the spatial device of 1 neighborhood unit, taking care of social integration, public administration and the predictable city’s growth. It has to be considered that it will realistically double its population in 25 years.

The changing conditions of this complex factor that determines     the variability of our local and national contexts can be effectively measured thanks to quantitative and qualitative indicators, which could be calculated using Gis, thanks to elements of geostatistics and numeric cartography. This course will illustrate,     then, the speculative basics of the need of using Gis for the quantitative and qualitative landscape analysis.

                                        <p><b>Objectives</b>: Every catastrophe could be also considered positively as an opportunity, to learn from, enjoy its anticipation and live through if the society is ready for. Today, it is inevitable that every city around the world has to face directly or indirectly the 21st-century impact of global warming. Milan maybe may not seem to be in the front line, yet, it has all potentials to become one of the frontiers of resilience.The course will analyze the main parameters of global warming and Milan case reactions and anticipations, in both public and institutional levels. As all collective and individual decisions and actions, fashionable or modest count, Milan case will be explored from diverse and cross disciplinary point of views. The course will criticize in specific the evolution of last 15 years of Milan toward resilience scenarios.The student will work on a short research (visual and/or textual) essay to be agreed with the professor. The subject will be related to contemporary Milan response to global warming, with a specific focus on daily routines. It will include research, images and short movies. The evaluation will consider the layout quality of the research work.The student will conceptualize a critical reflection and the hypothesis of target group(s). The steps of investigation and documentation on will be planned in advance with the professor. The student will represent, through graphic work, the outcomes of the research essay. Graphic and scientific quality will also be considered in the evaluation of the work.
