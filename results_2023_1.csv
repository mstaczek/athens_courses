nature of public spaces in post-socialist cities began to expand. With the new
economic model of urban development, in addition to classic streets, squares
and public green spaces in modernist housing estates, we also have gated
communities, shopping centres and privately owned public spaces (POPS). Most
often, POPS are part of new office and commercial projects.At the
workshop, we will discuss the nature of public space and its development and
analyze some examples of POPS in Prague. In groups, students will investigate
POPS urban and architectural characteristics, the form of behavioural control,
and see if and how POPS affects people and their activities in the place. At
the end of the workshop, each group will present one selected POPS in Prague.With this
knowledge, in the second phase of the workshop, students will identify and
describe selected POPS in the city where they are studying. They will perform a
similar analysis as they learned at the Prague workshop. For the next three
weeks after the Prague workshop, there will be twice-a-week a two-hour
consultation at which the students will present the following outcomes:1. identified
POPS in their city2. explain its
history and development3. describe its
urban and architectural features in comparison with the public space in the
vicinity4. describe the
activities that take place in POPS and the forms of control present in POPS.At the end of

cities.WHY?Humanity, especially the people living in the ever
growing and densifying cities all over the world are facing major problems
related to climate change, flooding, droughts, pollution, noise, water quality,
heat island effect. In densified cities, people not only need space in their
apartments but they also need public space where they sport, wander, and cycle,
relax, commute, and interact with others. In general, we could state this is
about the liveability of the environment. Through resilient urban planning and
greening, cities can become more pleasant and healthier places to live in.The above description is maybe nog that difficult to
grasp, accomplishing is a serious and wicket problem. Nevertheless a great one
to work on.The department of Management in the Built Environment
and Landscape Architecture & Urban Forestry of the Delft University of
Technology organizes an Athens week about this theme.Making cities healthier and greener is, on the one
hand a matter of design and planning and on the other hand a matter of getting
things done. Design and Management go hand in hand. Designing is about knowing
your context and knowing what to design. Getting things done relate to the
social, technical, ecological, financial, and governmental construct of cities.
Getting things done is about understanding and working with multiple
stakeholders.","The programme of the week:During the Athens week, we would like to approach this
challenge trough collaborative group work. Groups of 5 to 6 students work on an
assignment and a real case in a district in the city of Amsterdam. Students
from different background like governance, management, urban planning,
landscape architecture, water management, ecology or and agriculture are more
than welcome and work together in teams. Students that want to know more about
Management in the Build Environment or Landscape Architecture for their Master
thesis are able to get to know our university and experience our way of
education.We will make a challenging five-day program with
attractive daily lectures and themes, daily tasks and a final group assignment
presented to a jury. Lectures by scholars from the university and professionalsprofessionals from practice both broaden the knowledge
exchange. We will organise an excursion to the district in Amsterdam for a walking
and cycling tour, and lectures on site.We strive for about 32 to 42 students to make groups

35,Norwegian University of Science and Technology,Sustainable Hydropower Development,"Students should be enrolled in a   master program in Renewable energy, electrical engineering, Civil Engineering   or equivalent.","Hydropower has been developed for more than 120 years, and accounts for around 16% of global electricity generation. Among the renewable technologies, hydropower is by far the dominant source of production, accounting for almost twice the volume of renewable power from solar and wind power together. Still, there is the potential to increase global hydropower generation, particularly in Asia, Africa, Central America, and South America, and hydropower will remain one of the main sources of renewable electricity, together with wind and solar power. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) the installation of new hydropower will and must continue in order to reach climate emission targets. As hydropower is still the only large-scale renewable technology to provide regulated power, the role of hydropower might change into being the principal enabler of the integration of unregulated solar and wind power. In the light of climate change, hydropower is definitely part of the solution by offering significant potentials for reductions in carbon emissions, but will also be directly impacted due to potential change in the water resources available for power production.Though hydropower is now a mature technology, there is room for technological improvements and need for adaptation to new challenges, such as new market conditions, the increasing focus on sustainability, and the role in the water–energy–food nexus. Situated at the crossroads of two major issues for development (i.e. water and energy), hydro reservoirs can often deliver services beyond electricity supply, such as supply of water for irrigation and domestic consumption, water supply to the industry, flood control, navigation/transportation and recreation.The main objective of this course is to give the students an overview of hydropower technology, hydropower resources in Europe and globally, hydropower planning including environmental impacts of hydropower, and how it can contribute in sustainable development together with other renewables.",Day 1:The role of hydropower in the energy system Introduction to hydropower technologyHydrology – providing the fuel for hydropower Assessment of the hydropower potentialDay 2:Environmental impacts – hydrological changeEnvironmental impacts – barrier effectsVisit to Sagelva hydrological and meteorological stationsDay 3: Full-day excursion to hydropower sites in the regionDay 4: Environmental impacts mitigationHydropeaking operationsEnvironmental impact assessment proceduresSustainability assessment methodsHydropower technology and structuresDay 5:Numerical and physical hydraulic modelsDesign of hydraulic structuresSediment problems in reservoirs and waterwaysVisit to the hydraulic laboratoryPreparations for examExam (2 hours)The program can undergo changes.,"The exam will be written in ‘open   book’ format.

Today, it is inevitable that every city around the world has to face directly
or indirectly the 21st-century impact of global warming. Milan maybe
may not seem to be in the front line, yet, it has all potentials to become one
of the frontiers of resilience.The
course will analyze the main parameters of global warming and Milan case
reactions and anticipations, in both public and institutional levels. As all
collective and individual decisions and actions, fashionable or modest count,
Milan case will be explored from diverse and cross disciplinary point of views.
The course will criticize in specific the evolution of last 15 years of Milan
toward resilience scenarios especially during covid-19 pandemic and post
pandemic period.The
student will work on a short research (visual and/or textual) essay to be
agreed with the professor. The subject will be related to contemporary Milan
response to global warming, with a specific focus on daily routines. It will
include research, images and short movies. The evaluation will consider the
layout quality of the research work.The
student will conceptualize a critical reflection and the hypothesis of target

54,Arts et Métiers ParisTech,Smart Materials and Intelligent Processes,"Basic
knowledge inmaterials and the mechanics of materials.","We are at the dawn of a technological revolution that will fundamentally change our relationships with others and the way we live and work. These changes, in their importance, scope and complexity, will be unlike anything humanity has known until then. We do not yet know what will happen, but one thing is certain: our response must be comprehensive and involve all stakeholders at the global level: the public sector, the private sector, academia and civil society.Technology and the industrial world will also be overturned. In this
situation smart materials and intelligent processes have a special place.Today, it is observed that smart materials are increasingly used for the
realization of technologically important devices and formulations. However, due
to their relative novelty, it is worth asking questions: what are smart
materials, how do they work and what are their applications? The most important
smart materials are:-         
shape memory alloys, polymers and composite which have the capacity of
recovery the initial shape after a large induced form change

-         
thermos-strictive materials; the materials which undergo
changes upon temperature.-         
Chromogenic & Halochromic Materials which change color in
response to electrical, optical, thermal or acidity-         
Magnetostrictive Materials which exhibit change
in shape under the influence of magnetic field and also exhibit change in their
magnetization under the influence of mechanical stress.-         
Piezoelectric materials; they
produce a voltage under applied stressBy Intelligent processes we mean the additive manufacturing. Additive manufacturing
technology is an advanced manufacturing technology used to make parts directly
from a computer-driven program. The additive manufacturing process offers an
efficient technique for manufacturing parts with complicated geometries. The
materials transformed by these techniques are Metals, ceramics, polymer and
composite. The fields of application are vast: medical implants, automotive
products, and so on. Depending to the type of the material; there are several
additive manufacturing technologies: Selective Laser Melting (SLM), Selective
Laser Sintering (SLS), 3D printing by ultraviolet, melting of the powder by
electron beam, Stereo-lithography of reactive liquids, Fused deposition
modeling (FDM), …","The course of 45 hours includes:From March 13 to 17: face-to-face (on-site course in Paris)From March 20 to 24: virtual (at home - 2-3 hours at the end of each day)In this course, we

general objective of the course is to emphasize the reconciliation between
creative design processes and the use of natural resources and recycling
practices for the development of new materials for the design industry. An
industrial piece will be developed using as raw material pulp and sludge from
recycled paper, and applying simple manual manufacturing techniques. A system
of acoustic model solutions will be theoretically designed and one piece will
be physically produced. For incoming students, it presents a simple
introductory exercise for the design of an industrial object, while for more
advanced students it poses the challenge of applying the knowledge acquired in
profiling specific details such as the geometric conjunction of pieces, joints,
manufacturing processes, motif combination problems, texture application, tile thickness
combination, etc.","MON:THEORY: 2hWelcome session and
